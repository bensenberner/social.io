Friend: Hey, I'm Anthony, Rachit told me to contact you for more info about tech at spec. I'm interested in working on some projects, what openings are there?
Friend: I'm currently a sophomore in seas studying CS
Ben: Hey Anthony! Both our websites, courses@cu and print@cu, are running on rails. We're looking to implement a few new features into courses this semester before the next registration period. We also have a mobile app that we're about to deploy, written in objective-c. Do you have experience in web/mobile development?
Ben: You've taken ENGI 1006, right?
Friend: I have worked with some front end, HTML and CSS but nothing too serious. And I'm currently taking that now along with AP and fundamentals
Ben: Python and ruby are pretty similar
Ben: A nice respite from the memory craziness in C
Ben: Are you interested in doing frontend/backend?
Friend: Yeah for sure haha and yeah so I'm pretty interested in working with fronted / backend or with the mobile app. I wanna pick up a new language and really work on a project outside of the courseworks
Friend: How many people are currently working on these projects?
Ben: We currently have five devs
Friend: Okay awesome, how can I get involved in these projects?
Ben: We're having an open house on Saturday
Ben: http://www.spectatorpublishing.co/join/spectech
Ben: You can come by and we'll tell you more
Ben: And if you're feeling really gung-ho then I'd suggest doing some ruby tutorials
Ben: I can recommend a couple if you'd like
Friend: Awesome I'll stop by! And yeah that'd be great!
Ben: http://guides.railsgirls.com/
Ben: despite the name, boys and girls can use it
Ben: codecademy has a very basic ruby course
Ben: and other than that you can google around
Ben: the official ruby docs are great https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/
Friend: awesome, i appreciate it! see you on saturday!
Ben: Are you available to talk real quick?
Friend: Hey, what's up man? I'm in AP right now
Friend: I will be at 5:25
Ben: Aiiight call me then
Friend: Can you ring me into spec?
Ben: You there?
Friend: Yeah you coming?
Ben: Yurrrp
Friend: Come through and text me
Ben: Here
Ben: Here u at
Ben: Where
Friend: Turn up
Friend: Let's go
Friend: what are you doing lol
Friend: defenestrate, yay!
Friend: go to physics recitation
Ben: do u think my ignorant ass is ready for a recitation yet
Ben: I’m still reading chapter 23
Friend: go right now
Friend: at 7:10
Friend: he just goes over stuff
Ben: there’s another one tomorrow at the same time
Friend: I can’t go tomorrow
Ben: I guess our fates were not meant to intertwine
Friend: lol true
Friend: What'd you get on the Hw's?
Ben: I’m doing horribly
Ben: 9 and then 7
Ben: I gotta step my game up
Friend: Yeah they're really fucking us
Friend: I didn't know you were switching into seas
Ben: I’m only gonna do hw at the physics help room
Friend: You need a lab too right?
Ben: yeah
Ben: that’s the only reason I’m doing this shit
Ben: Yeah but I’m doing that next semester
Ben: PHYS 1493
Friend: Do you have a lot of requirements left?
Ben: no
Ben: just the lab
Friend: You're probably ahead for the CS stuff so you'll be fine
Ben: yeah I’m a class ahead
Friend: Which CS classes are you in this semester again?
Ben: just discrete, fundamentals, and web dev
Friend: Ah okay, and next semester you'll take comp linear, CS theory, and prob stat?
Ben: I’m in stat now
Ben: that’s what puts me ahead
Friend: Also, I don't remember seeing you Friday lol, hope everything went well
Ben: 😉
Ben: oh yeah hah
Ben: carl whisked me away to 1020
Friend: Carl?
Friend: Lol
Friend: Oh

Ben: *shawty
Friend: Yeah, that was rough
Ben: hah damn
Ben: you know adam lieber right
Ben: have I asked you this before
Friend: Nah, but I know him, he's a good guy
Friend: He was tight with one of my suite mates from uva
Ben: yeah he and I were floormates last year

Ben: judging from the culpa reviews thats what other people are doing too
Friend: And review Hw before Thursday?
Ben: yes please
Friend: Aight, sounds good and what'd I miss btw?
Ben: I’m scared to look at it
Ben: nothing
Ben: we just modified your contact info
Friend: Ah okay, seems easy enough
Friend: As 🍰
Ben: on the github.io site
Ben: yeah it’s just a modification, git add, git commit, git push
Ben: E Z
Ben: are you free to do the physics @ 9:00
Friend: I have bid deliveries tonight, but wanna go over answers at like 11 or 12?
Ben: ok
Friend: Hartley? I'm up in the sky lounge
Friend: Two other kids from our class are gonna come through too
Friend: Lol damn, that blows, when are you gonna start physics?
Ben: I still have to read like 2 hrs of stat
Ben: fmylife.com
Ben: I started on the first one but honestly I think I’m going to finish by 3:00
Ben: next time man
Friend: True haha fuck her
Friend: Good luck man
Ben: we’ll team up and take tanya down
Ben: U 2
Ben: It wasn't until I was halfway back that I felt awake enough to stay
Ben: Damn
Friend: Lol, I really hate this class, let's switch spots
Ben: By 10:45 I just switch off
Ben: She's lost me to the abyss of integral confusion
Friend: I just write down random letters and numbers...I'm lost
Friend: 2 more classes...idk if I'll make it
Friend: no more caps lock key
Friend: ￼do you know why this shit gets highlighted for no reason?

Friend: nvm it’s because of typos
Ben: this guy isn’t nearly as well dressed as dan
Ben: I don’t think I can pay attention
Friend: Haha I kinda wanna leave
Friend: Also, the hw is ridiculous
Friend: tell me if you make progress with the hw
Ben: Aiiight
Ben: We are definitely having a fundamentals sesh tm after spec
Ben: Dw
Friend: oh for sure, what times the meeting?
Ben: 6:30
Friend: did you guys get some of it?
Friend: I may have gotten part 1
Ben: Me too
Ben: but I didn’t work w them bc I didn’t feel like going to law
Ben: hah
Ben: we’ll go over it tomorrow
Friend: lol i gotcha, fuck fundamentals and fuck physics
Friend: lol i haven’t been reading
Friend: dude, the book sucks and tanya sucks
Friend: they all suck
Ben: FUCK I gotta read chapter 25 of physics
Ben: u r a goon
Ben: okay well what do you do to not suck
Friend: i’m bitter haha
Friend: i go to sebastian
Friend: he doesn’t suck
Friend: Okay, a bunch of people are meeting up around 8pm from our fundamentals class if you wanna go to that
Ben: Tomorrow? Yeah
Friend: Yeah, hopefully this is the last time that we use MIPS
Ben: HOLY SHIT
Ben: ￼
Ben: literally gonna whack off to this piazza post
Friend: Oh fuck yes
Friend: ￼Nahh
Ben: if you don’t do it I’ll make you debug eat@cu
Ben: should I bother going to tanya or can I just read the txtbk
Friend: You can l
Friend: Look at my notes
Friend: And fuck eat@cu
Friend: I eat@chipotle
Ben: what if we had chipotle rewards
Ben: like perhaps
Ben: free chips???????????
Friend: I would use the app
Friend: Free guac!!!
Friend: Free fucking burrito
Ben: free water
Friend: Nah, water is only 50c
Friend: Not worth it
Friend: The meeting today better be fun
Ben: its gonna be a blast
Ben: james is back from code city
Ben: if you’ve finished the beginner shit we might have you work on the “intermediate” app
Ben: which, according to phil, is “significantly more challenging” than anything that came before it
Ben: as far as you’re concerned
Friend: Ah okay, makes sense since we're gonna stop using scaffold
Friend: Dude, he never stops working
Friend: And just finished physics
Friend: Fuck that cunt shit
Ben: Daniel “tim can you deploy print@cu”?
Ben: tim at 1:05 a.m. “I am trying.”
Friend: Come to classsss
Ben: I’m hiding in the back
Friend: 🙈

Ben: oh my nerd
Ben: Fuck This HW
Ben: a haiku by ben liam lerner
Friend: i’m done -Leo
Friend: Just kidding, i’m so fucked
Friend: Let’s pretend this is a part of printatcu and then Tim will do it for us!
Ben: “mmm yes I will handily take care of it within the owaaa”
Ben: that’s how he says hour
Friend: How’s the fundamentals going?
Ben: who cares
Friend: lol wanna work on it in the Hartley sky lounge now?
Ben: i’m having a stack overflow
Friend: come on you fuck
Ben: no bitch
Friend: you’re actually getting it to work?
Ben: i’m not trudging over to ur ass
Ben: no!!!!

Friend: no haha
Friend: take the Loss
Friend: are you still working on fundamentals or are you just giving up
Ben: Anthony PussPuss Kim
Ben: I’ll gladly pull an all nighter
Ben: to make sure I get full credit on the only programming assignment I’m gonna have all semester
Ben: that isn’t some bullshit node.js
Friend: ugh fine
Friend: Dude, i might have to skip spec tech tomorrow
Friend: I have to do my python hw due at 6pm tmrw
Friend: and if i’m at spec tech from 12-4:30 ish
Ben: what the heck??
Ben: my friend
Ben: alright alright just come to the one on sat
Friend: can you just tell me what we’re doing tmrw when you’re at spec tech and then i’ll do it after i submit my python
Ben: We’re probably going to a) have you do intermediate rails and b ) get your ass working on some actual spec shit
Friend: okay sounds like a plan
Friend: bout time
Ben: “bout time”
Ben: look who’s talking
Ben: scaffold city over here
Friend: lol why?

Ben: Bwuhh! Pay attention!! nag nag nag!!!!
Ben: “hey whatcha workin on”
Ben: “hey can I take a peek 😉))))”
Ben: fluck u
Ben: How's your workshop coming along
Friend: the intermediate?
Ben: Yes
Ben: If that's what you're on
Friend: I haven’t been able to do it because of this AP and Fundamentals p-set
Ben: okay
Ben: do you feel ready to work on real trap shit
Friend: Yeah, I wanna start looking at the code base for courses and look at elastic search and the scraper and shit
Ben: you can look at it right now
Ben: right?
Ben: the scrapers are in the lib directory
Friend: yeah do you recommend any code that I should start at?
Friend: we just volunteered, but James was going to assign us
Friend: but he’s been gone
Ben: start at for what
Ben: do you have a task assigned to you?
Ben: okay well he’s back
Friend: i’m just going to start of the bugs that interested me?
Ben: okay
Ben: which one
Ben: “projected finals schedule”
Friend: the waitlist one and projected finals schedule
Ben: “scheduler improvement”
Friend: yeah
Ben: custom event
Friend: but we talked about looking into elastic search
Friend: so that too
Ben: to do what
Friend: find different ways to make it better
Friend: like the ranking of search hits
Friend: like if you search “hum”
Friend: what should you get
Ben: too vague
Ben: that’s a tweak
Ben: there are more pertinent bugs/fixes you need to do
Ben: why don’t you try it out and see
Ben: it’s fine
Friend: okay yeah that was just a list of potential things that we’ve talked about
Ben: okaaay
Ben: well I really don’t know much about the schedule
Friend: i’m not committed to any one project yet, so just tell me if there’s something that I should get one pronot
Friend: pronto
Ben: but as for projected finals schedule
Ben: you’ll have to learn how to scrape, right? do you know where that data comes from?
Friend: yeah, and no
Friend: how do I access the data from the wait lists of past years?
Ben: does that even exist
Ben: enrollment data is all from the bulletin
Friend: I thought there was data about enrollment sizes and wait list sizes
Friend: okay
Ben: and any data before 2014 has to be pulled through the wayback machine
Ben: waitlist size data doesn’t exist
Ben: I don’t think
Friend: ah okay
Ben: why don’t you go play around with the bulletin
Ben: notice how, when navigating, the URL doesn’t change
Ben: try and see how you can get around that
Friend: why can’t we just go into every semester
Friend: and then use the plain text format?
Friend: http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/sel/INCT_Spring2015_text.html
Friend: ￼
Friend: it’s on the right side
Friend: and i can look into parsing plain text
Ben: what?
Ben: a) what do you mean “go into”
Ben: and b ) how do you parse plain text
Ben: no
Ben: you should parse HTML
Ben: plain text, as stated, is for printing
Friend: can’t we use page source on the plain text page?
Friend: and that’s written in HTML
Friend: ￼
Ben: it’s one enormous <pre> tag
Friend: fuck
Friend: well
Friend: the links inside page source give you an actual link
Friend: http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/OHMA/G4999-20151-003/
Friend: like we actually get a different url
Friend: that’s the only way that i’ve been able to actually get a URL other than columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/
Ben: mhm
Ben: the home page has something called a “frame”
Ben: which is like a page within a page
Ben: that loads instead of reloading the whole page
Ben: here’s your assignment:
Ben: write me a simple ruby script that will print out every <a href> tag
Ben: given a URL
Ben: as input
Friend: okay, that sounds pretty fun
Friend: btw
Friend: you’re still the nerd
Friend: 😑
Friend: no lol, i actually hate her
Friend: i thought you were going to come back
Friend: but you never did
Friend: sit next to meet
Friend: I need friends
Friend: okay, i’m going to do some hw so i can try and get started with ruby
Ben: yeah ok
Ben: i saw what you did
Ben: you didn’t let me sit next to you so that a girl could instead
Ben: total dick move
Ben: gotheeeeem
Ben: great
Ben: byeee
Ben: I found the projected exam schedules
Ben: that’s a lot easier
Friend: what?
Friend: lot easier?
Ben: yeah
Ben: then navigating the bulletin
Ben: *than
Friend: https://ssol.columbia.edu/?tran[1]_tran_name=scel this?
Ben: yes Projected University Exam Schedule
Ben: it’s the same for everyone
Friend: yeah, and there are a few exceptions but those wouldn’t be too bad to make sure to include
Ben: ￼it looks like a clusterfuck but it won’t be that bad
Friend: valign=middle
Friend: haha
Friend: look likes vagina
Friend: and  it’s in the middle
Friend: lol
Friend: You*
Friend: are*
Friend: ftfy
Ben: U r 12
Ben: I'm actually coming today
Ben: Be proud
Friend: No way! I'll save you a seat
Ben: Yeah
Ben: Just getting a bagel first thoo
Friend: Lol okay
Ben: Why does she purposefully maintain that haircut
Is it a safety precaution for her research
Friend: Because she wants me to fuck her
Ben: "Bowl head booty"
Friend: That ass
Ben: She is drawing a curve that approximates her chest
Friend: 😒
Friend: hey cutie
Friend: Have you done #8 for fundy?
Friend: lol oh true
Friend: i should’ve used that
Friend: and i think there’s a pretty big typo on #8
Friend: so lemme know
Ben: bruhhh
Ben: I’m on 7
Ben: thank god wolfram alpha does booleans
Ben: he probably posted a correction you didn’t see
Friend: I don’t see it, but lemme know
Friend: or not
Ben: chill
Friend: fight me
Ben: u are actually one of the most violent people
Ben: like
Ben: I have a reputation on my floor for being aggressive
Ben: but u and I are like matter and antimatter
Ben: 💥
Ben: what’s the typo you saw?
Friend: i’m a pacifist
Friend: 7.Recall that m(i) is the product term whose variables are complemented when and only when their position corresponds to a ’0’ in the binary representation of i, e.g., m(5) = W ̄ X Y ̄ Z .


Friend: i thought min terms are when m(i) = 1
Friend: not zero
Friend: at least that’s what I got from his notes
Ben: that’s 9?
Ben: oh wait no
Friend: this si 8
Friend: nvm, i’m dumb
Friend: uh i didnt think so
Ben: real quick
Ben: is 5b a tautology
Ben: ahhh
Ben: god DAMN it
Friend: ￼
Friend: Am I wrong?
Friend: Yeah, this is really tedious and dumb
Ben: this is literally just unnecessarily complicated algebra
Ben: computers should do algebra
Ben: simplifying equations is not intelligence
Ben: no that’s right
Friend: ah okay
Friend: i hate this hw
Ben: it’s a PoS
Ben: in the mean way
Friend: hahaha
Friend: hey, you actually made a good joke!
Ben: yeah that was really difficult
Ben: probably the last funny thing I’ll say this week
Ben: relish it
Friend: ￼
Friend: Chase bank’s new arms
Friend: aren’t they pretty
Friend: Just like
Friend: Me :)
Ben: beautiful
Ben: just like
Ben: a k-map that you made using demorgans
Friend: True haha
Friend: Gym tmrw before physics recitation?
Friend: Haha I haven't read either, you don't need to
Friend: Recitation lol
Friend: Oh, and I'm a physics major
Ben: are you implying that I’ve read enough of the textbook to get away with that shit
Ben: then how do you know wtf to do
Ben: “i hate physics”
Ben: great attitude
Friend: Okay okay, but it is interesting nevertheless
Friend: What time is the hw due?
Ben: Fundamentals is due at 5:00
Ben: okay and I have to do discrete
Ben: ttyl!!
Friend: Good luck homie
Ben: what the fuck are these fundamental notes
Ben: “•essential prime implicant: when a function is “
Ben: great job dan
Ben: killing it since ‘06
Ben: okay that was my last rant
Friend: Hahahaha did you finish?
Friend: His slides are mediocre at best
Ben: this might be the fastest I’ve ever seen a class drain out
Friend: Why is this class boring
Friend: :(
Ben: Why r u so ratchet
Ben: some things have no earthly answer
Ben: girl in front of me has a pink background on her terminal
Ben: but she aint on that zsh so she can’t be The One
Friend: Wait
Friend: So, IM the nerd?
Friend: 😂
Ben: “when I’m doing coding, I do physics. Then I play crack open a mountain dew and play league for five hours”
Ben: —Anthony “Sit up straight” Kim
Friend: haha the fuck?
Friend: also, what is he talking about..
Ben: I noticed you slouching
Ben: assuming that’s you in the red shirt

Ben: and then i’ll hang ur commit on the fridge
Ben: let me check this two line change out
Friend: okay, and Section.all.map{|x|  [x.id, x.location]}
Friend: use that to see the location of each one
Friend: every location should be correct
Friend: and..?
Friend: okay haha
Ben: I see exactly what you did
Ben: ugh I don’t feel like testing it tonight
Ben: chill
Ben: this is just some OCD bug that daniel kept blabbing about
Friend: lol daniel LOVES LOCALHOST:3000

Friend: those will be your selector, and two inputs
Ben: please tell me you’re up
Ben: I don’t get this at all
Ben: I don’t understand the premise

Friend: man up
Friend: i just worked with the kid who had the pebble watch
Friend: in hexadecimal
Friend: almost done korean, then look at korean vocab for a little then look at AP recitation notes and code and sleep
Friend: haha I do
Friend: tmrw is going to suck balls
Friend: idk if I wanna go to my 8:30 python class
Ben: nice gender norms faggot
Ben: Im A Strong Jewish Man Who Dont Need No Nerds
Ben: (to do physics)
Ben: yeah right!!! “case studies” pfffff just go to office hours
Friend: lol, i think i’m going to skip it tmrw just because I have my AP midterm
Ben: thats a valid reason
Ben: sucker
Friend: are you up?
Friend: i have a question
Ben: is it about AP
Friend: char a[][10] = {"hello", "world" };
Friend: char *a[] = {"hello", "world" };
Friend: what’s the diff
Friend: i get the second one
Friend: but the first one
Friend: the syntax
Friend: what does the [] do?
Ben: in the first one you’re explicitly allocating exactly 10 bytes for helloworld
Ben: which leaves no room for the null
Ben: vs. the second one will create an array large enough to fit both strings
Ben: it says
Ben: OH WAIT
Ben: idk what the context is
Ben: but if jae’s being tricky (which he usually is)
Ben: then I think it’s saying
Friend: a[0] for the first one is a char*
Friend: so it’ll print “hello”
Friend: ah okay
Friend: hmm
Friend: OH FUCK
Friend: it’s just like how you can go int x[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4};
Friend: but he did that with “hello” and “world”
Friend: and then like you said, each sub array should have 10 spaces allocated
Friend: so it’s “hello     “
Ben: “create an array. I won’t tell you how big it is. Each element in this array is an array of chars. each of those sub-arrays is of length 10”
Ben: BRAIN BLAST
Ben: dude ur like dexter from dexter’s lab + jimmy neutron
Ben: and no!
Friend: “hello     \n”
Friend: well, technically we don’t know what’s in the other space
Friend: it’s garbage
Friend: it still has the null terminating character right?
Friend: ahh
Friend: okay
Friend: this is making more sense now
Friend: wow, that’s pretty tricky
Friend: you’re right btw
Ben: it’s ‘h’ ‘e’ ‘l’ ‘l’ ‘o’ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Ben: okay yeah
Ben: you didn’t zero it out
Ben: no wait
Ben: it’s ‘h’ ‘e’ ‘l’ ‘l’ ‘o’ ‘0’ ‘garbage’ ‘garbage’ ‘garbage’ ‘gb’
Ben: btw there are two ways to automatically zero-out an array
Ben: that you’ll thank me for later
Ben: 1) instead of using malloc, use “calloc”
Friend: cockoc?
Friend: 😉
Ben: guh huh huh
Friend: gosh…i should sleep soon
Ben: the second way is, and this works for any kind of array
Ben: of any type
Ben: let’s say for int
Ben: int[number] = {0};
Friend: char[10] = {0}; ??
Friend: does that work too?
Ben: that’ll make an array of ten null bytes
Ben: yes
Friend: okay
Friend: hmm
Friend: that’s dope
Friend: what about int[10] = {9};
Friend: array of 9s?
Ben: who do I look like
Ben: gcc?
Ben: try it out
Friend: ok
Friend: thanks man
Ben: K TY LY
Ben: GN
Ben: Emre’s been putting in work on his courses task

Friend: lol
Friend: same
Friend: i really wanna lock on down
Friend: i would be SOOOO hyped then
Ben: Wanna be a bad boy and skip fundamentals to do physics
Friend: Haha isn't that counterproductive because we have a fundamental review today?
Ben: Oh shit nvm
Friend: Lol
Friend: Scrub
Friend: 🙈
Ben: Yeah right like he's actually gonna be helpful
Friend: Doubtful considering his track record
Friend: What'd you get on the last two hw?

Ben: or does that come from simplifying
Friend: Uh I don't know :/ I haven't even looked at fundie
Friend: Gonna have to cram a ton tonight
Ben: We are definitely not doing midterm relevant stuff in physics
Ben: Are you still gonna go
Friend: Yeah, I had Python too
Friend: Come to class
Friend: We're doing chap 29 lol
Ben: Who the f**k cares

Friend: What tricks?
Ben: X + (not X)( Y ) = X + Y
Ben: A + AB = A
Ben: how to quickly do demorgans using duals
Friend: uh
Friend: duals doesn’t give you demorgans?
Friend: I have no idea what you’re talking about haha
Ben: negative duals
Ben: nvm
Ben: it was something my friend did
Ben: but its just demorgans
Friend: ah okay
Friend: it takes more steps, but i guess depending on the question given, it could be a cleaner way to approach the answer
Friend: I really hope he doesn’t just fuck us up
Friend: Hey
Friend: are half and full address on the midterm?
Friend: And ripple carry and carry lookahead adder?
Ben: what are half and full addresses????
Friend: adder*
Ben: oh
Ben: look for adders, shifters, w/e
Ben: we don’t have to know the inner mechanisms
Ben: just what they do
Ben: i’m pretty sure
Friend: Okay, I feel like we didn’t really get practice with the second half of Lecture 5
Friend: like we practiced a lot up to MUX
Friend: but the adders and ripple carries we barely touched
Friend: are you going to go in depth for those?
Ben: no
Friend: k
Ben: yo you gotta finish the midterms
Ben: one of the questions is hilarious
Ben: FUCK dude I’ve barely touched physics
Ben: you and me
Ben: we’re gonna sit down together and crank out all the hw problems
Ben: ride or die niggas
Friend: haha okay
Friend: which one?
Friend: and same
Friend: i just woke up
Friend: Do you wanna go to the gym really quick after Fundie?

Friend: like, it took at least 20min to understand the first MIPS problem
Ben: what happened to goofy “I put pics of myself dancing on the exam” dan
Ben: “hurrr I thought of the questions so I know the answer”
Ben: like
Ben: is the prompt clear?? no!!!
Friend: haha
Friend: yeah it really wasn’t

Friend: I got the 89
Friend: Lol I wish
Ben: same
Ben: but not A range
Friend: Yeah, since 55 is an A and 35 is a B, A- is probably around a 45+ but that's ridiculous that you can get less than a 50% and still get in the A range
Ben: IKDR
Friend: ?
Friend: I know damn right?
Ben: oh well if it’s 45+ then I’m good
Ben: the D was an accident

Ben: He's all about the work
Bout the work
Not answers
Friend: Smh

Friend: and make spec tech Jan - Present
Friend: i have your approval 😊
Ben: yeah the formatting on top is a little cluttered
Ben: but otherwise looks good
Ben: Maybe I should put my HS on there too
Ben: yeah and about.com’s as well
Friend: yeah, but I haven’t worked there yet haha
Friend: I wanna take out the I^3 analytics one in internships and put abou.com
Friend: and take out huffman encoding and put in a person project
Friend: persnoal
Friend: but right now, i have to do that stupid shark ppm programming thing for python
Ben: Are you ready to rumble
Friend: I’m still doing Python and AP 😟
Friend: also, I have no idea what we’re doing
Friend: do you?
Ben: I have some idea, yes
Ben: I worked on catching up for a few hours last night
Ben: Python is just brute force work!!! You can do it
Friend: aight, let’s meet up at 8pm and crush it
Friend: yeah, I just have to clean up the code
Friend: and then comment for pep8
Friend: and for AP, i just wanna find this little bug, and commit 1 more time before I submit
Friend: but 8:15ish
Friend: let’s fuck Fundamentals
Ben: This is going to take you six hours?
Friend: No, but I have an honor board meeting at 5pm and then chapter at 7pm

Friend: I’m at Lehman -__-
Friend: i know, but i’m tired
Friend: lol dude, I’ve literally spent 10 seconds on fundamentals
Friend: i need to just start and then ask questions when I start looking at the material
Ben: its like a block away
Ben: ￼
Ben: come over here you dork
Friend: let’s meet up tomorrow right after class?
Friend: or are you busy
Ben: ufhhhhhghhhhh
Friend: lol if not it’s okay, i’m just going to chug away at this shit
Ben: Ffffine
Friend: what’s different about the 3 latch flip-flop?
Friend: that the output from time t is outputted at time t+2?
Friend: instead of the original flip-flop where output from time t is outputted at time t + 1
Friend: ?
Ben: Yea
Friend: that’s it?
Friend: how lame
Friend: fuck fundie
Friend: fuck danny
Friend: for 2 a and b, did you draw a state diagram or truth table?
Ben: state diagram
Friend: okay dope
Friend: i did that too
Ben: WAIT no my bad
Friend: it works…so i’m hoping it’s right
Ben: I did that for 3
Ben: how did you do a state diagram lol
Friend: otherwise…i’ll just look at your truth table
Friend: picture should send on
Ben: I just made a circuit
Friend: sooon*
Ben: wtf
Friend: ￼
Friend: lemme know if my answer makes sense
Ben: 2 literally says to use flip flops and combinational circuitry
Ben: why did you use a state diagram
Friend: ￼
Ben: smh
Friend: it was an option on piazza
Friend: and it seemed easier
Ben: aiight son
Friend: lol but does my answer make logical sense?
Friend: or are you not gonna check it
Friend: i could be completely incorrect haha
Ben: ughhh
Friend: okay okay
Ben: you check ur own shit nigga
Ben: do three test cases
Friend: I'm on 4 finally
Ben: that was quick you shit
Ben: “i’m not smart” shut the fuck up
Friend: Well i’m not 100% sure I got the whole “state” thing correct
Friend: cunt monger
Friend: also, my 3b is wrong
Ben: wah wah wahhhh
Friend: nvm I fucked 3 up
Friend: bleh
Ben: nice job doofus
Friend: did you finish it?
Friend: and always so negative 😟
Friend: dopeeee
Ben: yes
Friend: you still up?
Friend: what’d you get for 3a
Friend: how many states did you get
Friend: no lol
Ben: is this a booty call
Ben: 3
Friend: for 0 1 and 2 mod 3?
Friend: what inputs did you have for each output?
Friend: I told you that I was dumb haha
Friend: bruhhh, no love?
Ben: bwuuhhh
Ben: what “inputs”?
Ben: for the state machine?
Friend: yeah
Friend: like when you write 00/1
Friend: or like 1/1
Friend: or whatever
Friend: 😟
Friend: ah okay
Friend: damn
Friend: i thought I tried that, maybe i’m dumb
Friend: what does 0 / 1 represent?
Friend: 0 is the In(t) and 1 is the output at time t?
Friend: did you use the hint he gave us?
Ben: ur a scrub
Ben: for 00
Ben: 0/1 leads to itself
Ben: 1/0 leads to 01
Ben: for 01
Ben: 0/0 leads to 01
Ben: sorry
Ben: 0/0 leads to 10
Ben: yeee
Friend: and did you try it when the value mod 3 is equal to 2?
Friend: hmm, i either wrote your state map incorrectly, or it doesnt account for the 1 mod 3 and 2 mod 3 switching that the new bit exhibits
Friend: blehh
Friend: fuck me
Friend: Fuck Danny
Ben: hahahaha relax
Ben: what’re you having issues with
Friend: 3b and 4b and c and a
Friend: Blahh
Ben: why do you think you did it wrong in 3b
Ben: do you know how to fill out the table from the state machine?
Friend: No lol
Friend: I have part a im pretty sure though
Friend: At least from what people were saying in piazza
Ben: look on page 28
Ben: of lecture 7
Friend: Okay, I'm in CC still, but I will during fundie
Friend: Grazie
Friend: Does that show you how to show the table using a jk flu flop?
Ben: yes
Friend: ☺️
Friend: Are you 100% done?
Ben: no I haven’t officially worded number 1
Ben: but other than that, yes
Friend: Little Einstein 😋
Friend: Hey, how much did it cost to take a class over the summer?
Friend: hi 😊
Friend: lol i googled it…but is it really 1570 per credit
Friend: like fuck columbia
Ben: Hey,
Ben: https://www.google.com/search?q=columbia+summer+class+tuition&oq=columbia+summer+class+tuition&aqs=chrome..69i57.3232j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8
Friend:  / does it go on your transcript as a pass / fail
Friend: or is it an actual grade
Ben: yeah ik
Friend: lol
Friend: i wanna take CS theory over the summer
Friend: but like..it’s so expensive
Friend: PLT recommends that you’ve taken CS theory
Ben: real grade
Ben: for a real man
Ben: uh huh honey
Ben: don’t you wanna get the most out of ur INTERNSHIP
Ben: whats the big rush huh
Ben: then take plt later
Ben: or just jump in headfirst
Ben: hey guess what
Friend: what?
Ben: I don’t understand the fundamentals textbook OR the lecture notes!!!
Ben: 😫
Friend: lol same
Friend: fuck this
Friend: which CS courses are you going to take next semester then?
Friend: databases and…
Ben: accounting and finance
Ben: linear
Ben: cs theory
Ben: phys/chem lab
Ben: I should probably take a track course tho…hm
Friend: databases is a track course for Intelligent Systems
Ben: yeah but like, a class that actually relates to it
Friend: and for Aplications and shit
Ben: aka Machine Learning/NLP
Ben: I’ll try both of those and see what fits
Friend: ah okay, I think I might take NLP with some UI Design or something
Ben: Kayy
Friend: Jk
Ben: April fools
Friend: NLP, UI Design, and OS
Ben: Lol
Friend: all three
Friend: get at me
Ben: Talk about overclocking
Friend: Well, UI Design isn’t supposed to be a super heavy class
Friend: and there’s an online course for NLP, so instead of taking a summer class, i could just do the courser
Ben: An online class you'd get credit for?
Friend: no, you wouldn’t get credit
Ben: Well I guess it'd be good prep
Ben: Do you still have the cracking the interview book
Friend: No, just the PDF
Ben: it’s missing!!
Friend: check under the couches
Friend: the PHP book was shoved under there once
Ben: good memory
Friend: 😟
Ben: a dead end, unfortunately
Ben: Coming
Ben: Here
Friend: coming up
Ben: http://physweb.bgu.ac.il/COURSES/PHYSICS_ExercisesPool/48_Induction/e_48_2_003_s_TeX.pdf
Friend: ￼
Friend: How'd it go hombre?
Ben: pretty well
Friend: that’s awesome dude!
Friend: Did they ask you a ton of coding questions?
Ben: actually no
Ben: it didn’t
Ben: now that I think abou tit
Ben: they asked me about elevators
Friend: Lol what?
Friend: Isn’t the best way to position elevators to have one at the top and bottom so that it gets to the people the quickest?
Friend: 😟
Ben: ffffuck you and your experience with everything
Ben: well
Ben: that isn’t general purpose
Ben: how would you describe their behavior
Ben: how do they pick which floor to go to
Friend: you just stick your penis out and let it go
Friend: duh
Friend: you tell me
Friend: Time to learn C++ from Jae
Friend: Lol
Ben: god
Ben: I went wayyy too into detail
Ben: “should I use a priority queue or a bst??”
Ben: god
Friend: oh lol
Friend: well at least you know your shit
Ben: barely!!!
Ben: fukkkkken god damn shit ASS
Friend: Dude, they love that you know all your data structures
Friend: that’s good, that means that you’re considering all the cases and factors
Friend: that’s all they want
Ben: idk what they were looking for!!!
Ben: I definitely thought about edge cases a lot
Ben: I even asked him stuff like “how long should I expect an elevator to take to stop”
Friend: you crushed it
Ben: okkkkk
Friend: 😊
Ben: thanks bud lylt
Ben: Hay
Friend: Hi

Friend: So…i may have locked myself out of my clic machine
Friend: i’m an idiot
Friend: i chmod incorrectly 😕
Friend: dude
Friend: i can’t get into my directory

Friend: A suite mates
Ben: ur own?
Ben: dude sleep > tanya honestly
Ben: tomorrow morning I’m gonna clean up my room and read over sebastian’s notes
Friend: You're probably right
Friend: Gym right after physics?
Ben: yeah!!
Friend: Okay, dope see ya then homie
Friend: 11:30, back and bi
Ben: duuuude why do you even go to classsss
Friend: Probably lol
Friend: Dude, I struggle at physics

Friend: Doesn't help me
Ben: like
Ben: you’re up right now
Ben: so you’re going to sleep until 9:30 and get up for her BS?
Ben: but like
Ben: go to the physics help room
Ben: talk to the TAs
Ben: that’s what I try to do
Friend: Lol I'll see you after class
Ben: 😔
Friend: Night man
Ben: ok buddy
Ben: sleep tight
Friend: Skipped class haha
Friend: Gym still?
Ben: Same
Ben: Wanna go at 1
Friend: Already here
Friend: We were supposed to meet when class ended :(
Ben: Im sorry!!!! I just got up
Ben: how far in are you
Friend: Finishing in 30 min
Friend: Next time haha
Friend: Spec today
Ben: waaaah
Ben: ok
Friend: I need to catch up in AP...midterm 2 is coming up
Friend: Aw fuck haha
Ben: that one is a doozy
Ben: lemme tell ya
Friend: How do you use a buffer in python 😟
Friend: Buffer functions look scary
Ben: uhhh
Ben: you mean
Ben: how do you make one
Ben: for the picture thing?
Friend: yeah
Friend: yeah
Friend: mhm
Friend: and so i read from the file 1 byte at a time?
Friend: okay haha
Friend: no python
Ben: you create an array of how long you want your buffer to be
Ben: you have some kind of counter to keep track of where you are in the array
Ben: init to 0 obv
Ben: as you go through whatever you’re going through
Ben: sshhh
Ben: let me type
Ben: ohhhh this is for AP
Ben: okay
Ben: w/e
Ben: so for every garbled thing you take from your source
Ben: whatever you want to put into the buffer
Ben: every time you put it into the buffer, you increment the counter
Friend: but while I’m reading file
Friend: how am i reading it into the buffer
Friend: read(1)?
Ben: and you have to have some kind of loop that is iterating through the garbled mess
Ben: so right after you add something to the buffer, you check to see if your value has reached the length of the buffer
Ben: if it has
Ben: write the contents of the buffer to whatever you want to
Ben: set the incrementer to 0
Ben: clear the buffer
Ben: and continue
Ben: one line at a time
Ben: one element from each line at a time
Ben: I don’t know what the “file” is dummy
Friend: and if the line isn’t a multiple of 3?
Friend: like, the number of elements in the line
Ben: it doesn’t matter
Friend: oh true
Friend: because the buffer is indecent from that shit
Friend: you right
Friend: thanks mr. poopy man
Friend: If i’m creating a buffer of size 3 because I only want to read RGB values. Why do I have to clear the buffer if I reset the counter?
Friend: well, doesn’t it not matter how I format the “new” ppm?
Ben: why would you do that you dumbass
Ben: you want it to be the dimension of the width of the image file
Ben: so that you can create a new ppm
Ben: a better ppm
Ben: where the dimensions of the values correspond to the dimensions of the picture
Ben: no it makes it a lot easier to work withi
Friend: But i’m not working on it?
Friend: You’re right but it technically doesn’t matter right? Because I’ll always be creating a buffer of size line length
Friend: I guess it does make using multiple effects on the same file much faster
Friend: because it’ll have a cleaner loop iteration
Ben: if the number of lines in the ppm = the height
Ben: and the number of values per line = width / 3
Ben: *width times 3
Friend: thanks btw
Friend: Also, I’m taking NLP, Databases, and UI Design next semester!
Friend: With prob/stat and CS Theory
Friend: i’m just going to take Linear algebra senior fall
Friend: since it’s only given in the fall
Friend: yeah…like the old curriculum / the BA curriculum doesnt require you to really take prob/stat and linear
Friend: so it’s clearly not SUPER necessary
Ben: is that what you decided on
Ben: oh yeah bc what james said
Ben: about taking stupid classes later
Ben: good idea
Friend: or necessary at all
Friend: yeah that’s a smart move
Friend: prob stat is more important than linear
Friend: and if linear is offered in the spring, then i’ll take it i guess
Friend: ￼look at that beauty
Friend: I might drop NLP, Databases or UI Design if it’s way too much work
Ben: I took probstat so I would get ML/AI shit
Ben: kay
Ben: yuuuch
Ben: too much stuff in the morning
Friend: lol there’s only two 10ams haha
Friend: and one of them in finance and accounting which is a joke
Ben: lol hahah
Friend: I could move prob stat to 2:40
Friend: but that professor sucks
Friend: also, what’s your professor’s name?
Ben: Mark Brown
Ben: he literally gives us the hw answers
Ben: but that makes his tests difficult
Friend: ahh okay
Friend: the 2:40 one is mark brown haha
Friend: idk if his shitty teaching style is worth not waking up for a 10am
Friend: oh haha well i guess that answers it
Ben: yeah pass on that
Ben: I mean
Ben: unless you’re good at teaching yourself from the book
Ben: like I am
Friend: ehh…i’m not that good
Ben: Ehhh fuck u
Ben: Yeah you are
Ben: Sleep is good
Friend: haha ehh 😕
Friend: you’re better
Ben: wow
Ben: you’re even better at flattery too
Ben: go to sleep and leave me to my mediocrity
Friend: okay haha night man
Friend: lol wut
Friend: so random
Ben: ￼allahu akbar
Ben: I'm running a task
Ben: Look at the number of workers
Friend: oh
Friend: my
Friend: you’re horrible
Ben: Dad I'm bored!!!
Friend: Leave class then
Ben: I'm not bored enough to let you get ahead of me

Friend: no, like courses to take
Ben: Omfg sick reference dan
Friend: lol it was a good movie
Ben: I Know!!! I'm jewish!!!
Friend: lol true
Ben: Tru
Ben: What courses r u looking at
Friend: Network security
Friend: And stuff like that
Friend: Idk
Ben: wtf
Ben: That's so math heavy
Friend: How was the rest of class
Friend: And yeah...it's all tentative
Ben: Stupid
Friend: I got ruggles 8th floor

Friend: Mhm...I'll see you in class buddy
Ben: ￼
Friend: Woo!! One of us! One of us!
Ben: such a good weekend
Friend: i just saw…
Friend: fucking shit
Friend: look at UI Design too…same shit
Ben: ￼COCK
Friend: Also why is one 4150 class open and the other restricted
Friend: fuck that
Ben: get raped
Friend: any idea?
Friend: no
Ben: bc you touch yourself at night?
Friend: i wanna take the better prob/stat class
Ben: gotta make compromises
Ben: ￼#BangBang
Friend: That’s pretty solid
Ben: yeah a solid dildo up my ass
Ben: I can forget about that gf with this schedule
Friend: Lol you can do it all
Friend: you would drop one of those right?
Friend: Yeah
Ben: at least
Friend: Depending on what happens with Prob Stat
Friend: I might take OS
Friend: yeah, but it supposedly still good though
Ben: hardcore dude
Ben: OS w/o Jae
Friend: i hate picking classes
Ben: I'm sure the classes hate being picked by you
Friend: yeah, they probably do, but not as much as they hate being picked by you
Friend: ooooooh snap
Friend: ?
Friend: lol
Friend: fuck you
Ben: ehehhehehe
Ben: that was funny
Ben: I had such a great time with that girl
Ben: I keep thinking about her
Friend: and…
Friend: do you think that you guys could date?
Friend: / is she from new york originally?
Ben: yes / no
Friend: 😕 it’s tough
Friend: especially since it’s so hard to find a decent girl here
Friend: how do you know this girl again?
Friend: is this the girl you met over the summer?
Ben: yes
Friend: damn
Friend: What does she want to do?
Ben: Go here
Friend: senior in HS?
Friend: junior?
Friend: freshmen?!?!?!
Friend: 😮
Friend: 😉
Ben: first one
Friend: ah
Friend: did she get in?
Friend: btw…i’m not going to be at spec tech tomorrow because I need to go to Physics recitation on tuesday instead of wednesday since I have my AP and Korean midterm on thursday and i’m going to get railed
Friend: and there’s a good chance that I take a 0 for this physics p-set just so that I can completely focus on AP
Ben: shit!!!
Friend: aight thanks man
Friend: and…what’s stopping her from coming here!!!!
Friend: 😊
Ben: yes she did, the school wants her a lot
Friend: DUDE! that was the biggest fucking obstacle
Ben: dw about spectech
Friend: SO…
Friend: what are her other options
Friend: ?
Friend: come to columbia and marry ben lerner
Friend: oh
Friend: lol
Ben: pretty much nothing
Friend: BOOM!
Friend: I’m so happy that it worked out!
Ben: Penn and Brown and Berkeley
Friend: that’s great man
Ben: lol but she’s pretty much set on here tho
Ben: no thanks to me 😉
Ben: You're a good friend Anthony
Ben: 👬
Friend: lol you are too dude
Friend: 😘
Ben: ￼Middle of a perfect day
Friend: matching pettycoats
Friend: too cute
Friend: does she wanna do CS?
Friend: because if she sees us in SpecTech getting all touchy…she might get mad at you
Ben: No she's either going to do history or physics
Ben: Hahaha I wouldn't let her near the toxic trough of spectech
Friend: lol i’ll recruit her
Friend: i’ll teach her some “rails”
Friend: 😮
Friend: jk, that’s your jon
Friend: job
Ben: You're goddamn right
Friend: hahaha aight man, it’s late, i’ll see you in class
Ben: I already forked that repo ;)
Ben: R u talking about physics
Friend: Yeah
Friend: And omg just make sure to pull before you stash
Friend: I know that you should stash before pull
Friend: And then apply stash, just go with it
Ben: Oh my precious nerd
Ben: How shall I praise thee
Ben: Alright I'll "see you" in physics
Friend: I skipped Python and physics today
Ben: I was wondering where you were!
Friend: did we learn anything?
Ben: I wondered that from my cozy bed
Friend: Fuck
Friend: NLP is also wait listed now
Friend: everything is filling up so quickly
Friend: fuck seniors
Ben: I know!
Ben: Only one person in it tho
Friend: What about PS?
Friend: Is
Friend: Os
Ben: fuck
Ben: I might have to take machine learning
Ben: ewww
Ben: no!!!!!
Friend: lol why not’?
Ben: because it’s hella hard and I don’t want to do software systems
Friend: ah okay
Friend: PLT?
Friend: it’s a 4100
Ben: also not on my track
Friend: PLT and databases
Friend: sorry
Friend: i mean UI design and databases
Friend: those waitlists are insane
Ben: fine I’ll tentatively add it
Friend: they might move the class to a larger room
Friend: that happens sometimes
Ben: yeah you can forget about those
Ben: lol
Ben: that’s why they’re letting 80/65 kids in
Ben: idk
Friend: just signed up…ugh
Friend: fuck that
Ben: To the wait list?
Ben: What does ur whole scheme look like
Friend: I’m in 4 classes, but on 3 waitlist
Ben: Hahahah Jesus
Ben: Oh
Ben: Seven total
Friend: ￼
Ben: Still tho
Friend: Ideally I would drop PLT, and take NLP and UI Design
Friend: btw
Friend: i’m in linear algebra
Friend: with you
Friend: i’m emailing to see if I can get into probstat at 10am
Ben: How'd you get accounting
Friend: It just let me
Friend: Did you not?
Ben: It says restricted
Friend: You taked to your advisor and shti right?
Ben: Yeah yeah
Ben: I can definitely just ask the guy
Ben: Are you emailing the stat guy now?
Friend: yeah
Friend: and there’s only 50 people in that intro counting class
Ben: Shweet
Friend: yup
Friend: just emailed the prob/stat dude
Friend: he seems really young
Friend: no culpa reviews
Friend: Lemme see
Friend: Fuck school?
Ben: DUUUUDE
Ben: FIVE WAITLISTS
Ben: JESUS CHRIST
Ben: ￼FUCK
Friend: Wow
Friend: Every CS class filled up
Friend: Fuck that
Friend: We need a larger CS department
Friend: Like 3 more professors
Ben: seriously.
Ben: fire the art department or some shit
Friend: yeah haha I was surprised that even CS theory and Linear got filled up
Friend: since databases has enough people to fill two sections and still have a waitlist
Friend: they better open up a new section or change the class room to fit more people
Friend: wow
Friend: finished going over the midterm from last semester
Friend: I would’ve gotten around a 40ish
Friend: that was hard af
Friend: even with the answers I had to really dig deep into my C knowledge
Friend: fuck Jae
Friend: he’s so fucking good at making test questions
Friend: the one where you have to make the messaging client without using Pipe was easy, but the forking and the other shit was hard af
Friend: al;kjfa;dskfj
Friend: blowing up your phone
Ben: love u too
Ben: I had a practice one with characters based on One Tree Hill
Friend: Lol that's weird
Ben: im pretty sure he’s metrosexual
Friend: Pretty sure you're metrosexual
Ben: that’d be sick
Ben: I would know exactly what to wear all the time
Friend: next weekend?
Friend: preferably before the final
Ben: when are we actually going to learn this shit
Friend: i might leave class
Friend: not learning anything
Ben: lol
Friend: i wanna rail the girl in front of you
Ben: nah lets do it after
Friend: yes
Friend: i can see what you’re typing
Friend: i feel like the NSA
Ben: dudeeee this is what we’ve been building for
Ben: how is no one here

Friend: If you’re in SEAS, you can register for finance and accounting
Friend: it is not a restricted IEOR course
Friend: there’s a fucking prob stat section that is restricted to fucking IEOR only
Friend: but the open section conflicts with computational linear algebra
Friend: CS wants us to take both
Ben: ssol still thinks i’m in CC
Ben: updates at 2:00 a.m… yeah right 😟
Friend: and columbia does not provide a 3600 section in the fall
Friend: so I HAVE to take 4150

Friend: by then…we should be done…hopefully haha
Friend: and how’d the CUIT thing go?
Ben: kay
Ben: it went fine
Ben: I couldn’t describe the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java
Friend: oh…i couldn’t either haha
Friend: oooh
Friend: i see now
Friend: interface (like comparable and you take methods)
Friend: blehh
Friend: that’s a tricky question
Friend: I’m so rust with java already
Ben: dude tell me about it
Ben: I’ve barely used java since August
Friend: same…This is why you have to keep all your notes and shit
Friend: Also, it might be worthwhile to create a really nice interview guide
Friend: I kinda wanna make one
Friend: with tidbits about little exceptions for java and other languages and the algorithm stuff
Ben: Let's whip up a google doc
Friend: Why don’t you whip up my dick
Friend: and yeah…it would be nice getting it done by the time the fall comes so that we have a big study guide to use on top of CTCI
Friend: lab7 is so hard
Friend: i have no idea what I’m doing haha
Friend: i’m like a blind person walking in a maze
Ben: Lol are you sure you can do anything that isn't AP tn?

Friend: Lol nerrrrd
Friend: The iOS class is Java now
Ben: I was wondering why it said “fava”
Friend: Ugh fuck that
Ben: What do you mean
Ben: "Spec tech is too laid back"
Friend: Lol
Friend: not in a bad way
Friend: i mean like, there are times when people just don’t show up and stuff
Friend: are you going through the applications?
Ben: No michael is and he's sending me the choicest bits
Ben: We didn't have a "come whenever" policy
Ben: People didn't come bc they were lazy and didn't feel the need to inform us
Friend: okay, i’m sorry!
Friend: i know we didn’t have a “come whenever” policy
Friend: where are you trying to go with all this?
Friend: This was a criticism of other people who didn’t show up / failed to give notice
Friend: ?
Ben: Well michael is going to make it into a "they should be working harder" thing
Friend: Oh, fuck that, this was the first year with spectech, they're not stupid enough to not consider that
Friend: fuck the rabbitshoots application…i don’t have time for that shit
Friend: are you doing yours? / is it mandatory?
Ben: I'll throw something together
Ben: I probably won't write the full thing
Friend: If i don’t have time, i’m just not going to do it
Friend: worst case: I just stay a junior dev
Ben: they still want you to write something for that
Ben: Yo
Ben: Wanna start fundamentals early this time
Friend: can’t 😕 I have a CC paper due tonight and I have korean hw / quiz and python “quiz” tomorrow morning
Ben: Damn boo
Friend: but tomorrow, after AP at 5:25…i’m down to start Fundie
Ben: How much are they paying you at about
Friend: $70000000
Ben: Unpaid??
Friend: they suck my dick every day
Friend: and buy me dinner
Ben: Or you're being humble and its 20 an hour
Friend: it’s $17, I just asked them for the industry standard and they gave me that. I probably could’ve negotiated for higher…but i was just happy to get an offer
Ben: Higher than CUIT 😔
Friend: how much is CUIT?
Ben: 15
Friend: and congrats on getting it!
Friend: that’s still a lot
Ben: Yeah but not for tech
Friend: for sophomores, 15-20 is solid

Ben: Hahahah poor Antony
Ben: Let's go to Sebastian's OH on Tuesday
Friend: yeah…both tuesday and wednesday
Ben: That's the recitation
Ben: I'm talking about one on one stuff
Friend: oh, yeah, for sure
Friend: let’s do it
Friend: what time
Ben: I think 2:30
Friend: okay, i’m down
Friend: let’s do it
Friend: let’s have him go over Circuits and RLC shit
Friend: because the first midterm stuff isn’t bad and the optics isn’t bad
Friend: it’s circuits thats going to fuck us in th ebutt
Friend: how come nerd tree doesn’t split the right side
Friend: like, i have it split up into a few sections
Friend: but i wanna specifically split one section in half and it keeps fuckign up and doing another section
Ben: Navigate into the right section
Friend: I did 😕
Ben: And from there open nerd tree
Ben: Ok

Friend: without clicking
Ben: Well you just have no game
Friend: 😟
Ben: Ctrl + w + direction
Friend: thank you
Ben: You're welcome my son
Friend: lol i need to spend more time with CS
Friend: i’ve kind of slacked
Friend: Tim is presenting at tech crunch??
Ben: YEAH WTF
Friend: That's absurd haha
Ben: god damn
Ben: what are YOU doing this morning
Ben: lol
Friend: ￼Packing up
Ben: Where are you going
Friend: home
Friend: lol
Friend: My parents are stopping by today and I’m going to give them a bunch of my stuff so that at the end of the year I can just drop my minimized pile of shit at my summer housing place on 109th and leave it there till work starts
Ben: Efficient
Friend: What is Tim's team number?
Ben: I don't know
Friend: Aw man
Friend: I watched two demos and they were ehh
Ben: There was a machine learning one with fashion
Friend: Some of these kids are hella smart
Ben: Right??
Ben: Damn
Friend: I wanna actually learn shit this summer
Friend: Need to catch up
Friend: We'll be like James after this summer haha
Ben: That's the dream
Friend: Yeah, we just have to do what you did last summer, gotta grind out a few hours of coding a day
Friend: But it'll be tough since we're working and we won't wanna code more :/
Friend: Then what do we do
Ben: Do stimulants until we want to
Ben: Pay people to beat us up if we aren't working to our full potential
Ben: During work, pull the move where you undersell your abilities and then overdeliver
Ben: So you'll have free time for tutorials
Ben: Specademy
Friend: Haha well you have to want to do it and I'm nervous that they're expecting a James, and they're only getting me haha
Friend: Lol he had the natural abilities in terms of brains and he was passionate
Friend: But I feel like I dont love CS as much as James does
Friend: Or Tim
Friend: You know what I mean?
Ben: Yeah
Ben: I don't always feel like staying up until 4 tinkering on shit
Friend: Yeah and I have other goals and stuff...I guess once we get into the workforce, we'll first just take any SWE job, but then we'll start gaining skills and be able to pick a job we actually love
Ben: Plus the learning curve for making things from scratch is so steep
Friend: Work hard to put yourself in a position to make decisions about your job and life
Friend: Yeah, it's insanely steep
Ben: Like you need a mentor or something
Ben: The insight and design decisions are so hard to glean on your own
Friend: Yeah...it is really tough...like we're both pretty smart, but still so lost
Friend: Aw man, I missed it!
Ben: You can rewind
Ben: hah I saw tim for 2 seconds
Ben: We should have an all-weekend coding sesh at my house in June
Ben: And make something
Friend: Yeah that'd be dope
Friend: Start building small shit and move up from there
Ben: Exactly
Ben: I think the adage is you gotta make 8 shitty things before you make 1 decent one
Friend: yeah…i just wanna make something on my own
Friend: Let’s build up our github
Ben: Yes
Open source projects
Friend: you have a good amount of stuff from your last summer doing tutorials
Ben: I didn't finish any
Friend: ah okay, well I wanna start some projects and shit
Ben: Except for the railsbridg ephedra
Ben: Ones
Friend: we have to hold each other accountable
Ben: Yes
Ben: We will each be the little voice in our head
Friend: haha yeah for sure
Friend: and then we’ll both work at google or Facebook next year lol
Ben: "Wow you didn't work on anything this weekend? Pussy"
Ben: Yesss
Friend: haha esxaclty
Friend: also, we’re going to create our dope study guide
Friend: for interviews
Friend: I have some study things i made from data structures
Friend: and we can learn red black trees and shit
Ben: Yeah
Ben: Maybe we could make the study guide into a website
Friend: Not a bad idea...we can embed some really good videos on certain topics and shit
Ben: Tim won something
Ben: Holy
Friend: What did he won??
Friend: Win
Ben: $2000 tickets to the official disrupt conference
Ben: I think he's going to pitch to investors
Friend: Oh he got a 3/5 or higher!
Friend: That's sick
Friend: Tim is insane
Ben: Yeah Jesus Christ
Friend: His app was practical
Ben: But he does have a few years head start on us
Friend: Yeah, and he also made a bunch of sacrifices to get they
Friend: There*
Friend: And he's super smart haha
Ben: I gave him some suggestions during the meeting
Ben: Haha yes
Friend: Yeah, idk if I want to sacrifice as much as he does
Ben: His work life balance is a bit skewed
Friend: It's fucked up haha
Friend: But that's my opinion
Friend: But he seems fully content lol
Friend: So good for him
Ben: Yeah he really gets a kick out of it
Ben: He gets so physically excitable when he's working on something
Ben: Brightens my day
Friend: Yeah haha like I enjoy this shit, but it's like porn to him
Friend: And I wish I were exaggerating lol
Ben: "Mm yessss show me what you got, hacker news"
Ben: As he breaks out the Vaseline
Friend: Hahahahaha
Friend: Ew
Friend: That's kind of disgusting lol
Ben: Judgmental much?
Friend: Nope
Ben: 😛
Friend: I masturbate to bleacher report only haha

Ben: you can’t hide your nature from me
Friend: 👱🏻
Friend: 💁🏼
Friend: Hahaha
Friend: I'd die
Friend: Okay, I have to shower and study
Friend: Grind baby
Friend: Don't grind a baby
Friend: That's illegal
Friend: But grind
Ben: tanya’s going to ask some shit like
Friend: Lol I need to put a sticker over my camera to look cool
Ben: “what is the optimal conductor shape for collecting electrons from the air”
Ben: and it’s going to be a bowl
Ben: I do what I want within the privacy of my own home
Ben: I won’t have the government meddling in my family affairs
Ben: w t F does that even MEAN
Friend: Also, you can't talk
Friend: I can't pick up ruby at all
Friend: Or rails
Friend: Why does ruby need rails?!?!
Friend: It's beautiful just as she is
Friend: Mhm
Friend: You can't talk
Friend: Ehh, I should've learned so much more
Friend: I partner coded a lot
Ben: I have been doing it since october
Friend: Emre is good / works hard too
Ben: not only that
Ben: but the “little” you picked up
Ben: you picked up quickly
Ben: uhhhhh who made a finals schedule thingyyyy
Ben: that’s true
Ben: ok go shower
Ben: then check out this startup http://www.placepixel.com/
Friend: That sick
Friend: I just wanna have an interesting job and be happy
Friend: I'm not going to make some sick start up
Friend: I'm not even close to being that smart or creative
Friend: Lol
Friend: Duck you
Ben: wow
Friend: Lol that was actuall funny
Ben: i wonder who else shares these goals of yours
Ben: Goose yourself
Friend: i’m watching soccer highlights now…
Friend: fuck…i can’t focus
Friend: and there’s a cute girl that just sat in front of me
Friend: dude, i’m trying to learn lecture 6
Friend: okay
Friend: i closed it
Friend: i’ll try to actually learn now
Friend: Sequential circuit design
Friend: first time we learn about latches and flip flops
Friend: yeah
Friend: so now our circuits are holding state
Friend: you think so?
Friend: lol wait
Friend: are you being sarcastic?
Ben: Just another day in the Life and Times of Anthony Kim
Friend: haha
Friend: okay
Friend: because it seems kinda cool
Friend: ah okay, makes sense
Ben: what’s lecture 6
Friend: …
Ben: flip flops?
Friend: maybe
Ben: yeah that’s DEFINITELY going to be on there
Ben: it’s barely on any of the practices
Ben: no
Friend: lol i understand the bigger picture
Ben: I can see how you interpreted that way
Friend: i just didn’t really focus in on the actual circuits
Friend: i just assumed that they would work
Ben: but he mentioned it on the list of topics to know
Ben: lol
Ben: are you only just learning what we’ve been doing this whole time
Ben: god
Friend: yeah, it’s so annoying
Friend: lol i ahven’t gotten there yet
Ben: hahah
Ben: I spent a good 20 minutes running my finger through latches
Ben: when we first did them
Ben: I still don’t understand what “edge triggered” means
Ben: ok buddy
Ben: step by step
Friend: Lol we shall overcome ✊🏻
Friend: the pulse triggered and edge triggered one is kind of weird
Friend: i think i get it…
Friend: i don’t think that we really use pulse triggered as much…we’re mostly concerned with edge triggered
Friend: the second half of lecture 6 is fucking ridiculous
Friend: wtf is this shit…DAN!!! YOU FUCKING SUCK
Friend: just finished lecture 6…why is it so fucking weird
Ben: some lectures are different than others
Ben: they all deserve your love and respect.
Friend: Yeah, fuck them all
Friend: I'm watching basketball
Friend: 2 point game
Ben: why did god need to rest on the seventh day
Ben: isn’t he Almighty
Ben: this story doesn’t add up
Friend: Hahaha he stopped to admire his work
Friend: lol little fucker
Ben: couldn’t he do that in like a clock cycle
Ben: god damn
Ben: i’m switching to buddhism
Friend: Wanna get some food?
Friend: I’m kind of hungry
Ben: I just pigged out on crackers and cottage cheese
Friend: “pigged out” lol
Friend: i might just get halal
Friend: it’s friday
Ben: You're worth it cuz you're beautiful
Ben: I'm in the Wallach lounge
Friend: lol why?
Friend: ahh okay
Ben: working w timaan
Friend: minimal progress has been made today
Friend: fack
Friend: I’m going to finish looking at lecture 11,12,13 then stop and start studying physics
Friend: when is stat?
Friend: yeah…I’ve spent too much time dicking around on fundamentals…need to start actually learning physics
Friend: since it’s 9am after fund
Ben: yeah same…
Friend: and i haven’t started with AP
Friend: 😟
Ben: I’m going to try and study with phil
Friend: save me
Ben: wednesday
Ben: but it’s the one I’m least prepared for
Friend: lol
Friend: who are they?
Ben: you’re making ME nervous
Friend: oh the dude with the fro
Ben: for you
Friend: oh
Friend: oh
Ben: I’m meeting up with julian and gelila tomorrow morning
Ben: people who are in fundamentals
Friend: yeah we lost a bunch of points on that shit
Friend: maybe we fucked up the earlier questions?
Ben: no
Ben: the dude with the mole on his head
Ben: according to my hw7 grade
Ben: frodude mislead us
Friend: yeah…i’m just hoping for a good curve in fundamentals
Ben: maybe
Ben: too bad we have to go to the 8th floor of cepsr and pick them up
Ben: god
Ben: not only is the material harder than high school
Ben: but we’re given less preparation
Ben: 😠
Friend: How have you prepared for physics thus far?
Friend: lol, you didn’t do anything else?
Friend: I feel like doing the homework questions don’t help THAT much
Friend: because they won’t be that tricky / imposisble
Friend: i.e. she won’t expect you too know the radius of a pupil
Ben: I went to both sebastian recitations
Ben: lo
Ben: lllll
Friend: ah okay…are you going to start tonight?
Friend: I need to learn what the hell caching is first lol
Ben: I’m going to reread all the recitation notes too
Ben: and then maybe I’ll do some textbook questionsth
Ben: that I shouldve been doing the whole time
Ben: dude you were LITERALLY asking relevant questions during office hours
Friend: I did?
Friend: i really don’t feel like i did
Friend: i don’t remember either
Friend: I just talk a lot
Friend: because my voice is beautiful
Friend: ouch
Friend: fine
Friend: bye
Friend: 😟
Friend: I finally understand what a hit or miss is
Ben: you just talk
Friend: slide 14 now of lecture 13
Ben: you just love talking
Ben: over people
Friend: 13 / 75
Ben: under topics
Friend: fuck me in your butt
Ben: around the bush
Friend: there’s a whole table of theta girls in reference
Friend: you would love it
Friend: so hot
Ben: 😛
Friend: 😐
Friend: my mind is elsewhere
Ben: great
Ben: 😾
Friend: So..i didn’t start physics yesterday
Friend: i tried to sleep early, but i couldn’t fall asleep quickly
Friend: 😟 time to start now
Ben: Good luck baby
Ben: let’s do fundamentals at 7:00 tonight
Friend: Maybe, I still need to do physics and AP
Ben: jeeeeesus
Ben: what’re you doing for physics
Friend: Read recitation notes first
Friend: Then my own notes
Friend: Then AP
Friend: Lol from when I used to go to class
Friend: And notes during recitation
Ben: you take notes??????????????????????????
Friend: Then I'll do some practice fundamentals finals
Friend: Then sleep
Friend: Then repeT in the morning and take the final
Friend: I planned poorly in terms of allocating time for all 3 finals
Friend: fundamentals at 9:30
Friend: if we get everything else done by then
Ben: It's so hard to study
Ben: So hot
Friend: Yeah, I'm still not done going through the recitation notes...
Friend: Takes me so long to read
Friend: Fuck, fundie and physics are worth so much...gonna get fucked...
Ben: where do you want to meet
Friend: I can't :/ I'm just starting AP :/
Friend: Fuck
Friend: I'm so bored
Ben: :/:/://://::/:
Friend: :(
Ben: SAME
Friend: You've been studying though
Ben: Barely
Ben: I just played smash
Ben: I'm finishing up his notes
Friend: notes?
Friend: or the slides
Friend: I’m reading the last two recitation notes for AP and then i’m going to do the practice final for AP and then start the practice finals for fund
Ben: Jesus
Ben: You haven't done any practice finals
Friend: dude. I told you, I’m boned
Ben: I guess I can't poach you
Friend: lol what?
Friend: and were the practice finals helpful at all though?
Ben: Yes
Friend: okay, i’ll get on them
Ben: But at the same time
Ben: He's probably going to do things that WERENT on the previous ones
Friend: Yeah i know what you mean…i’m definitely going to go over the homework solutions and see how they did things
Friend: i’ll probably end up thinking about how i’ll solve the problems and then just look at the solutions
Ben: Yeah no point in wasting time floundering around
Ben: We are far past the point of being able to ponder things
Friend: hahaha i know
Friend: we got this though
Friend: grind time
Ben: I got my first ever 15/15 on the last physics hw
Ben: lol
Friend: WOOO
Friend: Your final last year was hard af
Friend: That smart pointer question was hard
Ben: YES
Ben: thank you
Friend: yeah fuck that
Friend: what was the avg for that
Friend: like a 60?
Friend: ah okay, and time to start the fundie shit now
Friend: AP is going to be hard…
Friend: true
Friend: If we can pull off an A- in Fundie and Physics, that would be super clutch
Ben: something like that
Friend: I’m like not studying enough for any of my finals
Ben: EVERYTHING is going to be hard
Friend: the timing of them is horrible
Friend: do you have any more on monday or tuesday?
Friend: Fundamentals today and tomorrow morning, then right after I’m going to do some physics problems and do some AP then sleep and take physics and then study more AP then take AP
Ben: You betcha
Friend: then i have another on wednesday too
Friend: GET FUCKED
Ben: so you’re going to start doing physics problems tomorrow
Ben: yeah…
Ben: no
Ben: one a day
Ben: monday tuesday wednesday
Friend: …
Friend: 😟
Friend: Okay, I’m going to get started now…i’ll talk to you later homie
Ben: wow dude!
Ben: are you talking about yourself?
Ben: you should bring an anal dilator
Ben: to prepare
Ben: I salute you
Ben: I still don’t entirely understand what voltage is
Friend: Idk either haha
Friend: Fuck this class for not even teaching us that
Ben: fuck tanya
Ben: she wishes
Friend: I'm going through the 2010 final and it's hard af
Friend: I might finish it and sleep and then wake up kind of early and do the rest of the practice finals
Ben: Yeah it's at 1
Ben: You have some time
Friend: Yeah...I think I'll do that, sleep around 12 and wake up at 7 or 8
Friend: Get a solid 3-4 hours of studying
Friend: Fuck this shit dude
Friend: Let's make a start up this summer and then become bought out by Google and get jobs there and then roll in money
Ben: Yea honestly though
Ben: Let's take less classes and focus on web dev and data science
Ben: That's all that matters
Ben: Fuck circuits
Ben: Fuck electricity and magnetism
Friend: Let's take big data or Apps and api's course. Let's take one of the 6998
Friend: I have a class conflict with the one about apps and api's, but if you want, I would be down to take the other 6998 course with you...we can try to pass/fail it or I would be fine with getting a lower grade or possibly dropping the class if it's too much. Could be worth it
Ben: Yes!
Friend: ￼
Friend: could be solid
Friend: ￼
Friend: i have a class conflict with accounting and finance … but i might be willing to drop it to take this course
Friend: If it’s worth it…like curriculum and shit
Friend: We can't sign up again until the summer, but we should email the professors and see if they are worth not taking a "normal" track course
Friend: Yeah plus, fuck OS
Ben: yeah we can take “normal” track courses later
Ben: we should try and get actually useful material as soon as possible
Friend: 6998 should count as a track course too
Friend: Yeah, we can only take 6 credits of 6998 max
Friend: But I'm sure they wouldn't care if we took 9
Ben: did you scream yet
Friend: No, I was showering
Friend: Now I'm trying to sleep
Friend: Fuck this
Friend: Lol
Friend: Idk man
Ben: 😟
Ben: you’re the cramberry supreme
Ben: you’ll be in (relatively) good shape tm
Friend: just woke
Friend: great
Friend: lol
Ben: Same
Ben: Wanna meet in butler at 12
Friend: I'm just doing practice problems now
Friend: Idk if I'll have time to discuss ideas
Friend: Just too begging :(
Friend: Behind
Ben: No I just wanted to go over problems
Ben: But alright
Ben: We ARE doing physics together tho
Friend: Yes, right after fundie
Friend: I'll do physics with you, but I won't spend as much time as you because I have to study for AP
Ben: Yes dear
Ben: I understand
Friend: Yeah...that shit is going to be hard
Ben: dan put up the “questions that are relevant to the final”
Ben: like last night
Ben: motherfucker cocksucker
Friend: Poop
Ben: Where'd you go
Friend: I got a table
Friend: Fuck this class
Ben: I'm bringing a friend
Friend: When are you coming
Ben: Now
Friend: Had to deal with a lot of shit
Friend: but i’m in butler now
Friend: i need to do a few things before I start studying
Friend: but…i’m just going to read over notes and look at answers
Friend: I don’t really have time to do anything more 😕
Friend: i’m sorry i’m flaky dude
Friend: this finals season is not being nice to me
Friend: Well, where would we study/
Friend: ugh, how long is he going to be out for?
Ben: gooooooooddddddd

Ben: 😓
Ben: As you wish
Ben: Fuck
Friend: What
Ben: I am nervous
Friend: Same, I didn't end up studying
Ben: I barely did
Ben: I just looked over recitation notes
Ben: Forgot the context of everything
Friend: We're CS...just keep telling yourself that
Friend: Lol
Friend: I failed that
Friend: I fucked that up so badly
Friend: I didn't even know how to do like 3 whole problems
Ben: Yeah
Ben: I didn't memorize the equation for 7
Friend: Was that optics?
Friend: The one with the coated winDow was hard
Friend: Same with the B field and the force needed to pull at a constant speed
Ben: Yeah I totally forgot destructive interference
Friend: And same with the magnetic atoms
Ben: Yup
Friend: those were hard right?
Ben: Yes!
Friend: Okay haha
Friend: Just gotta shake it off...it's just one class
Ben: One C+ isn't the end of the world
Ben: But it is if it's AP
Ben: So go study!
Friend: Yeah I'm sure we got like a B at the very least
Friend: What'd you get?
Friend: Lol okay
Friend: Lol 61
Ben: fundamentals is up
Ben: higher than my midterm
Ben: fine
Ben: 68
Friend: Haha you did well man
Ben: phew
Ben: the average was probably in the 50s then
Ben: eh
Ben: my mips never compiled
Friend: Same haha
Friend: but fuck that
Friend: Yeah…it’ll be fine though
Friend: just get through it
Ben: fuck that class
Friend: I got what I wanted from this class
Ben: even though CS theory is going to be more of the same bullshit
Ben: wtf
Friend: I fucked up EM
Ben: I did better in E&M than I did in mechanics
Ben: 😟
Ben: lets drink to forget
Friend: Lol I told you that I didn't study and it showed
Friend: I'm not smart
Ben: DUDE
Ben: you were stupid to not study
Ben: but you’re smart enough to absorb the amount that you did
Friend: No :(
Ben: you’re like a fucking machine
Ben: you churn through material and spit out insight
Ben: Where are you
Ben: Wanna go to some bars
Friend: What time?
Friend: I'm at signu was talking to my parents
Ben: ahhh
Ben: midnight if you want to
Ben: or we can just chill

Friend: No
Ben: Every time you don't do it I'm docking $50 from your pay
Friend: Okay do that. I dare you
Friend: 😐
Ben: Caching just came up in my bitly interview
Ben: Maybe fundamentals wasn't so useless after all
Friend: Lol how'd it go?
Ben: The interviewers said they'd tell their lead dev that they liked me
Friend: You're going to get it
Friend: That's sick dude
Friend: Congrats
Friend: ￼
Friend: Hahahahaha
Friend: Dude, why isn't spectech chiming in!
Friend: This is hilarious

Ben: confidential.
Ben: jk
Friend: lol fuycker
Ben: people have a history of links they’ve made
Ben: it’s on their profile as a list
Ben: the search functionality for that list is limited and suboptimal
Ben: my first task is to optimize it
Friend: damn, that’s really cool man
Friend: i wouldn’t know what to do
Friend: and what language?
Friend: I know like nothing lol
Ben: dude
Ben: lol
Ben: you don’t even know their tech stack
Ben: once u see the diagram you’d be all “OH OK YEAH I GET IT”
Friend: lol i probably don’t dude
Friend: fuck you haha
Friend: i barely understand all the ruby shit we learned at spec tech this year
Ben: if you have a mentor then you could probably pick it up in a week
Friend: I just need to take the outside coding stuff as seriously as i take school work
Ben: dude I don’t even know how this shit really works
Friend: i just never worked on cs hard besides classes
Friend: dude you’ve ben working for less than a week
Friend: you’ll get it soon
Friend: usually companies will give you like a month or more to understand shit
Friend: btw, how was the trip with your gf?
Ben: un
Ben: real
Friend: and do you wanna watch the champions league final this saturday?
Ben: yes
Ben: but I’m going to be at a hackathon all weekend
Ben: http://nsq.io/overview/design.html
Ben: this is my reading material
Friend: oh shit which hackathon?
Friend: thanks for the invite man 😟
Ben: I bought it in SD
Ben: now its sold out
Ben: http://angelhack.com/hackathon/brooklyn-2015/
Ben: I am sorry
Ben: next one I’ll definitely tell you as soon as I decide
Friend: ah okay, for sure
Friend: i have a workout with a trainer tmrw to test me levels
Friend: it’s free when you join
Friend: i hope he doesn’t say i’m weak as shit
Friend: and he’s gonna check my bf
Friend: ahhh
Ben: Is ur bf hot
Friend: fuck you
Friend: yes he is
Ben: Send pix
Friend: he’s fake
Ben: ￼Here's mine
Friend: lol i gotta visit you sometime
Friend: hahaha you sound tired
Friend: i’ll come up for a weekend or something
Friend: Wanna get lunch with me?
Ben: yes
Ben: let’s get bareburger in chelsea
Friend: Okay, what time?
Ben: can you meet me there at 12:30
Friend: Yeah
Friend: Is that the one on 46th?
Friend: ￼Or his one
Ben: no
Ben: 17th street
Ben: 8th ave
Friend: Okay
Friend: I'll be there
Ben: 🐃
Friend: Here
Friend: ￼
Friend: You're texting from your gmail
Friend: Grabbed a seat inside
Ben: Good timing
Ben: I'm a street away
Friend: 😍
Friend: I fee like i’m not doing much work if I just use someone else’s template…
Friend: for a website
Ben: Lol
Friend: don’t you get that feeling?
Ben: Do you want to do front end?
Ben: Who cares
Friend: what do you mean who cares?
Friend: Don’t you wanna know how to actually make the whole thing?
Friend: or is it all about shipping
Friend: idk…dude i told you, i suck at CS
Ben: Dude you don't have to know everything
Ben: You can't specialize all over the place
Ben: People who make really nice sites and know all about layout and shit usually don't want to do the cool heavy duty stuff
Ben: Like working with data
Ben: Like we both know how websites work on a basic level
Ben: You know what they say about "standing on the shoulders of giants"
The giants are libraries and frameworks and templates
Ben: Try customizing someone else's site to suit your own needs
Friend: Yeah, I see where you’re coming from. I agree. I guess I just had a differing mindset going into it
Friend: but fuck it, might as well just dive in for once
Friend: i just wish I didn’t suck so much at this shit
Ben: This stuff isn't easy!
Ben: All the good resources are 9 week intensive courses
Friend: yeah like i spent 2 hours watching stupid lynda videos and they were useless
Friend: I just downloaded a bootstrap template and now i’m just going through it
Friend: I wanna do what you said about 8 projects
Friend: so i’ll do like 8 personal websites and see how they’re each made differently or something
Friend: so i would read and modify other people’s templates
Friend: and then at the end, i would try to combine the features that I liked the most
Friend: what did you do for your website?
Ben: I meant 8 rails apps
Friend: oh lol
Friend: fucking rails
Ben: I looked up "Jekyll sites"
Friend: did you add a ton of code to it?
Friend: or edit their template
Ben: Edited their template
Friend: aight, and what’s jekyll?
Friend: oh, it’s just for static content?
Friend: oooh jekyll is pretty cool!
Friend: better than bootstrap
Ben: Yeah
Ben: What do you want
Ben: Dancing anthonies
Friend: lol no
Friend: but thank though
Friend: also, let’s build that stupid basic android app for spec tech on weekend
Friend: the one that just distributes starts and redeems them
Friend: or we can just party
Friend: Bagel from absolute with strawberry cream cheese 😁
Friend: I got an egg bagel too! Omg were like twins
Ben: egg bagel at the hackathon
Ben: omggggg
Ben: heheheeeee
Friend: good luck at the hackathon! Ship shit!
Friend: 😘
Ben: there are some real characters here
Friend: like you
Friend: duh
Friend: Okay, so you might hate me
Friend: but i’m going to try and do what Ben Schloser did…the thing with the text disappearing
Friend: for your “i’m a ____ _____ _____”
Ben: You mean dan Schossler
Friend: yeah
Friend: haha
Friend: i’m dumb
