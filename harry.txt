 I'm testing to see how imessage works on a laptop
 sweet
 check your number
 not your email
 what do you mean "check"

 I have "you can be reached at" and my number and email are checked off
 and "start new convos from" my number
 on my phone
 phil!!
 sup
 i made u a background
 that celebrates your best tweets
 but I don't know how to send pictures here
 this is not as good as aim!!!
 Ôøºfigured it out
 do you like it I worked for 3 1/2 minutes on it
 okay fine phil
 I have a serious question
 lol
 what's up
 sure what time
 you and your brevity
 wanna go into together tomorrow
 *in
 don't you have a time you normally go in
 I can go in whenever
 mostly 8:48 sometimes do 7:18, 8:11, 9:11
 lol
 so...not 1:10
 kk
 hmmmm
 if I get up at 7:00 and sprint to the gym I could do the 9:11
 might do 7:18 lol
 why are you going in?
 lol
 kk
 maybe another day
 i can't believe you get up that early
 i have an internship from 2:00 - 5:00 and then class from 5:30 - 8:40
 internship is weekdays besides wednesday and class is tuesday and thursday
 lol why would u go in at 9:1q
 I don't usually I'm just going in early bc Annie starts at 9
 i thought 7:14 was early
 and there are office hours I can go to in the mornings before class
 what does annie start at
 her job lol
 Crazy Bitches Corp.
 (jk)
 riiight
 ?
 she works at Howard stern
 wtf
 that's a good gig
 yea
 intern
 oh
 that's not a job
 still an intern for howard stern
 good for her tho
 okay so you're lifting weights and drinking water
 but what's your diet like
 eating Doritos rn
 I pretty much only eat Doritos
 good protein source
 lol I'm kidding
 I do 1500 calories
 smh
 its like u have a hole in ur boat
 and ur putting in the work to shovel out the water
 but it just keeps coming in
 the water is a metaphor for unhealthy fat
 calories from what?
 mostly raisins and walnuts
 and bologna
 some water chestnuts
 dipped in bacon grease
 thanks for giving that a few hours of thought
 you're welcome
 Guess what Phil
 what
 I might have a free house tn

 Are you back from Iowa
 ive been in port lol
 I know
 It was a euphemism for do you wanna come over
 lol I'm at bayview rn
 I'm talking about later
 ya sure
 wrong use of euphemism
 Euphemism means nice way of saying something
 I assumed that being in Iowa meant that you didn't want to hang out w Nathan
 lol accurate
 Swing by at 6:00
 Are you coming?
 I'm eating
 gonna try to
 Cool
 are you at your house?
 In 70 seconds
 cool omw

 Oh no
 What's up
 You can't just not explain that

 she was really space
 spacy

 Yup
 Big curious eyes
 Never know who you're gonna meet on the internet
 lol
 Spotted Ian on the train trying on rings with a girl

 I just picked him up
 We're trying to get Nathan and jwass
 Take ur time

 On my way!
 Did he tell you the real secret
 Ya victor told me forever ago

 Webster hall
 Is it "girls and boys"
 Ya

 Whered you rebels go
 I'll give you a hint, we're not in the car with Jillian Knoll
 Hey phil
 Sup
 Got any ganj
 Lol who are you trying to smoke with
 Minah & friends
 I can give you a # of a dealer
 Johnny?
 Or 5
 Haha
 I mean I can give you his
 Are you mobile
 Who would be the most likely to get me some rn
 2.0
 Some weirdo in high school
 Yes I can drive
 Who should I drive to
 Getting u a number gimme a min
 Kk thanks a ton
 ??
 One sec
 Ôøº
 Say Ian sent you the number
 Ur the best
 No I'm a conniving cunt
 Who's trying to ruin toms relationship
 Get w the program Ben
 Ur taking that very directly and personally
 lol
 he tried to choke me out
 my favorite tom moment
 Haha victor told me everything
 did it paint me in a bad light
 No bc u deleted the pic..,
 did he tell you toms quote
 he was so weird
 he turned to me and said "gotta lay the ground work in case me and Ali break up"
 and then accused me of trying to make it seem like he was trying w these girls
 It was the most confusing series of events
 He got mad at me bc I "totally would snapchat it" even though I showed him it wasn't a snapchat....
 was he still that drunk
 No he was essentially sober
 It was 9am we stopped drinking at 2:45
 What the fuck
 And he still hates me
 but he tacked on the fact that I never hang out w you guys
 But like
 I've gotten ok w that recently
 I've had you guys over a bunch
 Now that work schedule got easier
 Yeah that's not valid at all
 and it's a lil difficult
 I sympathize w you now
 They are awful house guests
 No one cleans up after themselves
 They eat everything
 Yeah thank you
 My mom yells at me for not picking up like one thing
 Out of 2000 pieces of trash
 It took me like an hour and a half
 To clean up
 After the other day
 You literally have to tell specific people to do certain tasks
 That's when it's cooking
 People should at least clean their own specific trash
 Like finish a beer? Trash
 Eat chips in my living room? Don't make a mess and put them back after
 Preach
 Whenever people drink/eat have them throw it out before you move to another room/leave the house
 6 on Friday
 Start after 9 ur good
 when is that
 are you going to it
 is ian making you go
 I wanna go
 Sorta
 are you and her friends now
 We talk and take the train together
 cute
 is it at that place downtown
 near the wharf
 Nah
 Brooklyn
 oh damn
 a step up
 You at home

 Why
 Let's just hash things out
 Tomrorow during the day
 Too tired
 I'll go in late
 Ok when can I come over

 i was about to message you
 SFS
 Hahahahhahahahahahah
 we just got dinner

 That's too good
 Bring me medical

 then she came over and did coke off my dick
 hah no I didn‚Äôt see her but she is here
 she‚Äôs going camping tomorrow
 yeah
 you just screenshot the stuff i say about ellie
 i guess i‚Äôll just have to pick my battles
 ahhaha
 idc
 only good things can come from you phil
 nah I pooped this morning
 fertilize the earth
 so yeah I come back tomorrow at like 4:00, pack the rest of that day and friday, move in saturday
 cool I'll come watch you pack whether you want me to or not
 I'm into watching üòâ
 Ôøºso is this guy
 Guardians of the Galaxy spoilers!!
 Ôøº
 HOW DO YOU GET THESE INSANE PICS
 oh man
 that genuinely curious face
 kills me
 You know Molly has a huge crush on him rivht
 yes i‚Äôm aware
 did he send that to her
 and she sent it to you
 so what‚Äôs your deal
 when‚Äôre you moving in and shit
 he sent it to me
 I ofc screenshot red
 Screen shotted
 off you did
 ofc
 when‚Äôll you be in the city
 Idk haven't found a place yet
 Gonna have some boring port nights
 Probably go see if I stay by myself w a box of tissues
 For the semen not the tears obviously
 yeah why waste perfectly good lube
 It's more to keep it off the seats
 Is that sarcasm
 you should ask benny
 he‚Äôs a master apartment hunter
 It took him forever and he's in queens
 yes
 how was the place
 queens is great
 lots of great stuff there
 his subway ride is probably a good 9 minutes shorter than the LIRR
 Lol
 I didn't go to his show tn
 it‚Äôs pretty nice
 idk how much he‚Äôs paying for it
 or like any external factors
 but it‚Äôs got a patio and a nice living room
 i ran into a place called ‚ÄúLittle Palestine‚Äù
 for the family
 hey, Phil
 He‚Äôs in the city now. Things are different.
 is he still mad at you
 for existing
 ya who isn't
 let's see
 lemme look at my calendar
 3.5 months ago
 ya I have a pretty open schedule
 like
 Ik my boss quite well
 I've worked for him for 3 years
 As long as I make meetings and get shit done he doesn't care
 lol truuuuu
 when does ur job start
 ok smartass
 you‚Äôve been going to beach houses and shit
 when does the grind begin
 ahh
 dude
 such a Valley attitude
 lol
 what‚Äôs the avg age of the office
 not that young at all
 it's only like 1/3 engineers
 and it's all super complex shit
 the engineers trend older than the rest actually
 It's say like 30avg
 what do you mean ‚Äúsuper complex shit‚Äù
 like that the engis have to deal with
 Like they don't make iPhone apps
 It's really complex programming that like
 I can't even pretend to understand most of
 low level shit
 Yea but just weird shit
 phil tell me about it, this is what I‚Äôm learning!!
 we can finally converse
 you know what they do right
 programmer a programmer
 something about cable boxes
 They do addressable tv advertising
 So like you see an ad specifically for your house
 Based on your demographic
 And your neighbor sees something else
 where does that information come from
 a lot of places
 They're working on matching it w your credit card purchases now
 WTF
 who are you people
 I think that data comes from Nielsen
 how could you connect those two sets of data
 why is that not private
 http://adage.com/article/media/nielsen-tracks-bank-statements-credit-card-transactions/240439/
 oh so it‚Äôs anonymous
 Eswntially
 customer id #69420 of the Target Loyalty Program bought bananas and lube
 so we‚Äôre going to show them True Detective
 hmmm alright
 It's more commonly like how affluent you are
 When you last got a car
 What kind of cars you drive
 ages of residents
 I gotcha
 The only cool data I have access too
 I don‚Äôt get all the steps involved but I see the big steps
 Is how many people are watching which channel in each area
 ooooh
 And a lot of boring data
 Like ad playouts
 Error rates
 Etc
 Bc I built a system for the product management people to better track when shit goes down
 like when ad playouts start failing en made
 Masse***
 And everyone sees the default as
 what kind of shit
 everyone suddenly tuning into the Simpsons Marathon
 or everyone bought a lexus
 oh so technical shit
 Ad
 You never notice
 right it‚Äôs just a generic ad for the area
 You might occasionally notice a commercial play like half way thru then randomly cut to another one
 OOHHHHH
 That's us fucking up
 damn
 you sound a bit like jake eisenberg with all this tv shit
 Haha why what's his connection
 he had a sports TV internship
 ya I try to not talk like a complete tool while describing these things
 anyone who uses work vocab words outside of work is a try hard
 so he kept talking about ‚ÄúA slot B slot C slot‚Äù
 aka the first act, the second act, and then the little bit after the end credits of community
 yeah but it‚Äôs kinda like translating on the fly
 you want to say ‚Äúthe parameter for the function‚Äù but then you gotta say ‚Äúthe thing this takes in‚Äù
 I'm working on nothing related to tv rn tho
 whatcha working on philly
 I'm working on an algorithm to know when you're about to be hungry
 Which sounds super weird
 no it's on movie
 Mobile
 Like it knows so much info
 Then knows when you're hungry after learning all ab you
 IF you stay on the food network for more than a minute THEN show food ads on every single channel
 To keep you on your diet
 It's not just hunger tho
 It predicts so much
 Sleep
 Acne
 It's an interesting project
 so is it an app
 or something running continuously
 Both
 The app part tracks everything ab you
 Location habits movement level
 Blood pressure
 Glucose level
 So much shit
 you can get technical
 wtf
 that‚Äôs not direct data
 right
 it's gonna be
 ohhhh hahah
 Apples about to launch their watch
 Which is riddled w sensors
 i thought you were gonna use some super technical shit to predict these metrics
 Age of health tracking is ab to get real
 lol that‚Äôs simpler than i thought
 i thought it was just like
 No we have the metrics
 Then it's machine learning
 if you keep scrolling up and down on the grub hub app
 To predict other shit
 you‚Äôre a certain level of hungry
 Lol
 That was just an example
 But there was just one invented wasn't there
 W light
 that‚Äôs still awesome though
 what kind of sensor knows your glucose level without injecting you
 ahhh you‚Äôre right
 so apple gives you this stuff
 so that when it‚Äôs released it‚Äôll already have a suite of apps ready
 it's not like a secret
 it's built into iOS 8
 o
 idk all that new fangled stuff
 I‚Äôm trying to teach myself C using the classic text
 https://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/health/
 damn
 and here i thought health records were the big no-touch database of the world
 Health is the next field
 That's ab to be turned on it's head
 In my opinion
 Mind you I have a biased view
 But there's too much potential
 and we patented the learning part
 no I can totally see that
 people seem cool with giving up every other piece of personal data
 so this is the next logical step
 imho not abstractly enough
 But it wouldn't have gotten thru if it was any more abstract
 yeah how does that work
 patenting an idea like that
 is it IP?
 a patent is by definition intellectual property lol
 ip is patent trademark copyright
 okay
 you apply
 but you almost always need a lawyer
 Bc patents are complex as fuck
 Unless you're an industrial engineer and do a lot of self learning
 I guess
 right bc that‚Äôs all you do
 make inventions
 it's just hard if you're not an applied engineer
 bc so many diagrams and technical drawings
 and super technical descriptions have to be made
  even for an algorithm?
 ya
 and it has to be in breathless detail
 But also be as vague as possible without being too vague
 you want it to be wide so that it's highly usable as defense
 and offense
 if it's too broad it gets rejected
 so enough to describe it
 but without being so broad that it would encompass too many things
 most patents start out really broad
 Then get denied
 Then get more specific
 And repeat that process until it's just specific enough to get through
 bc if you start too specific then someone might come along and get a patent in a space that you COULD‚ÄôVE covered if you had been broader
 gotcha
 ya
 If you patent a knife to cut potatoes
 Instead of a knife
 Someone can make a knife to cut tomatoes
 what a pain in the ass
 software patents are the worst
 hardware is easier
 yeah i mean a thing is a thing
 you build an object in a specific way that carries out a purpose
 no no code
 just a lot more explaining
 No there's no like
 Software element to it
 Like it's all explaining
 do you patent pseudocode or something
 hah so you have to write out all your conditionals and shit
 Not the mechanism of how it's done necessarily
 Unless that's what your patenting
 Like for example we have a patent to use data collected by a device to predict nutrition and hunger levels
 It's more explaining intent than a mechanism frequently
 it can be either
 And both
 really?
 what something is SUPPOSED to do rather than how it actually works?
 Patents are so complicated
 hah I mean
 Luckily
 Bc that's what my dad does
 ‚Äúthis box is supposed to be able to tell you how good your marriage is. It works by both you and your spouse holding it while talking and seeing how hard you squeeze on it‚Äù
 Meeting tm
 Bed time
 Will pick up explaining in am
 To answer that tho
 No
 USPTO decides if it's specific enough
 Idk the specific guidelines
 But gn
 i look forward to it
 later
 lucky you
 lily‚Äôs not around
 it‚Äôs your perfect opportunity
 You coming to visit?
 Alright guess I'll see you around Phil
 What's gucci
 I was napping
 okay sleepy boy
 come over
 Are you packing
 yes
 come tell me more about software patents
 i won‚Äôt make you do any heavy lifting dw
 When do you leave
 Sooooooooooo...?
 tomorrow morning
 meaning it‚Äôs now or never
 wanna get food
 And bring Vic
 i am carless
 but yes
 only if we get going now
 alright i‚Äôm not going to wait around for you all night
 text victor for me
 why
 you‚Äôre the one wants to get him
 text him what
 Phil Jesus Christ
 He's not answering
 Okay so whatever
 Eat and come
 Or don't
 Are you home
 No I'll be back in a couple hours
 From where
 Mineola
 You guys chillin
 Kk
 I'm home now
 Guess you're preoccupied
 It seems like you wanted to wait until I was done packing to hang...thanks Phil
 If by preoccupied
 You meant
 Asleep
 Then yes
 Was extremely preoccupied
 You??? On a Friday night?
 When're you coming to visit to make up for this
 Whenever
 When should I
 on a weekend
 you can wait until I tell you something‚Äôs going down or you can come whenever
 Tessa
 Is in my home
 Senior scav sister
 I just made her move her car
 She gave me the most frightened I know you face
 EXCUSE ME

 Scare them or something
 KIM IS HERE TOO
 What a day
 You know what to do
 Tell them it's a rite of initiation
 I think john may have written the most self indulgent article of all time
 Lol
 I read it
 He's so delusional
 Phil do you understand
 He's going beast mode
 It's going to be epic
 He was too busy dreaming about the REAL WORLD to have time for silly simulations
 Disclaimer to his ardent followers: results may vary when dropping out of college.
 He failed out
 Lol
 well he would have failed out
 but he withdrew bc that was ab to happen
 Bc he was too busy mucking around at his office
 Meeting with Top Secret VCs
 I like how he emphasized apple'a revenue when he said that the marketing team hires non college grads
 Just to make sure we know that it's a pretty big company
 he definitely lost that internship bc of failing out lol
 I was wondering why he randomly decided to not do it
 Because "fresco is gonna be big"
 Yeah ok
 "Stunning photos from our own team of photojournalists" more like AP
 Hah and I didn't realize his flashlight app came out as soon as the iPhone got that capability
He's just a 49er
 First one to the gold
 Ya
 Lol what a fuck
 Everything post flashlight he didn't even make too
 He just used flashlight money to outsource it
 Ahhh
 Now his entire narrative makes sense
 Who else is in town
 I'm in NYC
 I mean in general
 Living there
 Ok Phil
  Fell
 Asleep
 Sick
Moves
 ÔøºCome over

 Who's in your pool
 Well you know dan lee and Hannah Zweig

 Not by name because it's just computer noises
 he is fantastic
 Not worth the price of an IMAX 3D movie
 It's like 20$
 He's so annoying
 Phil
 How do I get started on open source shit
 what does that mean
 do you want to use it
 or make it
 Make it..
 Modify it
 you should do some reading
 then ask me a question that makes sense
 Okay smart as
 What's a good way to get involved in a project
 start one
 or fork a project
 and if you do something good they might merge
 Okay how did you go about making your first things
 Like this omegle chat thing I'm looking at rn
 How were you doing this 5 years ago...
 lol
 doesn't work anymore
 id doubt
 ÔøºLol
 Lol
 Lol
 The vocab of obj c looks complex
 Did you use complex data structures in this too
 it's not
 Hash tables
 Black/red trees
 Mhm
 no
 My real question is if you have come across a bug lately in something written in Java
 I use java approx once in a never
 I use obj-c only slightly less frequently than that
 So you're still gonna visit in a couple days right
 Prolly
 Why not definitely
 Ok well when are you "prolly" going to come
 Oh look Phil, Juj is here and she's wondering when you're going to come
 What're you going to tell her??
 omfg CHILL OUT
 Phil I know you
 I need to anchor you
 Just tell me when you're busy...
 IM ON THE MEADOWBROOK PARKWAY
 Ok
 Stop texting
 EXAXTLY
 I KEEP OPENING
 N U KEEP HAVING ANXIETY ATTACKS
 DO NOT BUY THE REad receipt
 Literally just put the phone down
 I'm stopped currently
 Idc
 Bad habit
 Swift key
 Is so cool
 Is this a new discovery
 It just came out for ios
 Never used it before this
 Phil how do I get iOS 8
 While preserving space
 What
 If u don't hav enough space delete some videos
 i just deleted everything
 so exciting!
 lol
 for how long have you had it
 WTF
 Ôøº
 phil it‚Äôs stuck
 should I unplug it????
 I bricked it
 Oh shit
 Ur done for
 Jk put it in dfu mode
 yeah it‚Äôs all good
 whatever that means
 force restore mode
 "Device fucked up"
 Lol jk
 nice hacker joke 8-)
 I'm making NCC an app
 Reverse engineering their stupid site rn
 LOL
 dude that‚Äôs an .edu
 I'm not hacking it
 just figuring out how the site works
 So I can make an app do the same thing
 you can‚Äôt hack the government!!
 I'm doing this bc I made a script to automatically try to enroll me in the classes I want every 30 seconds during add drop
 And it worked
 no way
 what‚Äôd you write it in
 js
 on my node server
 idea what that is
 the only server i know is localhost
 It's just JavaScript as a server app
 all these schools use similar systems
 I should go over to columbia and sell my software to geeks obsessed w scjool
 So much less stress
 i can‚Äôt believe that would work
 why?
 It was so simple
 our database is down for like eight hours every day
 It just scraped the web content every 30 seconds and checked if the class had an opening
 like I can‚Äôt even check my registration
 and took the opening as soon as it happened
 W the app tho
 I have a WebKit engine running in the background
 So the site is like behind the app
 And the app does actions on the site and strips info off the site
 Ugh I wish u did
 ya lost me
 I don‚Äôt know this web stuff
 I love talking ab hacking around shit
 ‚Äúhacking‚Äù
 DO BETTER
 hacking meaning finding a sloppy solution
 get back to me when you‚Äôre implementing a priority queue with a stack
 not infiltration
 get back to me when you have to do that in the field multiple times without access to google
 ‚Äúthe field‚Äù
 (Never)
 Cs degrees are garbage
 They breed the wrong type
 The info is good
 i‚Äôll go out into the middle of kansas and do it
 I don‚Äôt even the java API
 ya ok
 It's just like a degree
 That doesn't really prepare you for the job
 you talk about it like what you do is all there is
 It's a weird degree
 I've done so many diff things lol
 some people don‚Äôt go into ‚Äúthe field‚Äù
 they just come up with better algorithms all day
 that's not the majority of cs students
 not even close
 hence the garbage
 more schools need to adopt a coop program
 like mandatory one semester in a job
 like Drexel
 hence the ‚Äúsome‚Äù
 says you
 I bet the NSA would like a really good encryption algorithm
 so that hackers like phil bernstein can‚Äôt change state school websites
 that‚Äôs pretty good
 we have a solid vision and graphics track
 Alright I'm on the swiftkey game
 I think I'll stick with predictive typing for a bit
 predictable
 Dude high five
 I loled out loud
 Doge hobo dive
 Yeah but you can't get enough sleep and I'm still not sure what the actual number one in a while ago
 The fact I can see it as an excuse for the next few weeks
 Ozetadev I don't think that I have a great way of the day before I get a follow back on my way home from work
 I gave it an "o" and it filled the rest
 Lol
 You've typed follow back
 And ozetadev
 Since yesterday
 Nuh uh
 It gets it from the big database
 It's tailored to u
 No way it went to follow back w o u typing it
 Zero chance of ozetadev
 Okay I imported it
 Ôøº
 I haven't said that in months
 lolol
 It must save from autocorrect duct
 DICT
 Yeah that's def in my vernacular
 How many ratchet NKK parties have you been to so far
 Did you see Debbie??
 1) I just go to the city
 2) no
 riiight
 its all rooftop/NYU shindigs for you huh
 ya ncc doesn't have a cohesive student body
 their aren't collective parties
 It's a half hour away
 maybe they don‚Äôt know how to organize
 they haven‚Äôt taken graph theory yet
 They're also all black
 ah
 not your cup of tea?
 not my cup of cotton
 Ozeta ‚ÄúImperial Wizard‚Äù Dev
 : ( | )
 there was a protest from the ‚Äúblack law student‚Äôs association‚Äù a couple nights ago
 half of em get law degrees bc they think their dad might be in jail since he's been missing for 17 years
 hahaha
 guilty of being a bad dad
 So are you visiting tomorrow?
 Don't respond if you're on a highway
 Lol
 Kk
 So I'm going to make other plans
 And if you ask "yo what's good" in 24 hrs I will ignore it
 Lol
 ÔøºUp to you
 "Lol"
 Lol
 Phil you were so gung up last weekend
 Fuck you
 I'm on a roof
 Text me In an hour
 No fuck you
 You text me
 You say victor is annoying...
 üòí

 yeah
 kk
 I got a lot of work done

 /rooftop party/
 that was fridsy
 Not the weekend
 who doesn‚Äôt have 3 day weekends
 I have a 9:30am on Friday
 Not a part of the weekend
 whatever
 wbu
 yes I did the same amount of work
 less jerking off due to the roommate
 ya I feel u
 that's why I didn't go back to UMASS
 very limiting to jerking off
 we just have a mutual jerk sesh
 ik thats v important to u
 going through your many directories
 usr/ozeta/documents/work/trash/secret/dontclick/annie
 lol
 u skirted the line very well there
 that text convo Sarah tweeted
 Was w me
 omfg
 If I never wanted to take Sarah to prom
 I would've avoided all the annie shit
 ?
 I only talked to annie bc she was friends w Sarah
 are you serious
 i thought you guys went farther than that
 I had never had a convo w her before Sarah
 Lol
 I added her on snapchat bc she knew Sarah
 like I didn't even have annies # before I asked Sarah
 annie texted Ellie who texted me
 That she'd go w me
 same thing happened with me and laura russo lol
 you fell in love w Laura Russo bc of Sarah?!!
 Cute
 haha nooo
 laura russo told me that sarah wanted to go with me
 ya I know lol
 ok
 It was a JOKE
 just making sure you remembered
 I couldn‚Äôt tell exactly what the joke was
 WEIRD Fucking times
 jesus
 yeah man
 you had bangs
 WTF
 I can be such a weirdo
 I always cringe looking back at the previous year
 Lol
 yeah
 just wait until 2020
 ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I listened to that shit‚Äù
 I think me n tom are made up
 awwwwwwwwwwwww
 He apologized again the other day
 For the 3rd time
 have you talked to victor lately
 no actually
 why
 n can I tell u a confidential story
 sure
 Ôøº
 I'm in a fb group w these kids
 and juliette was playing w ians phone the other day
 And accidentally sent the group
 A nude selfie
 L
 O
 L
 dude that would be SO funny if you had proof! ahahahaha....
 Never
 nude of her right
 Ya her boobs
 I legit spit water
 All over my computer
 not ian
 what was the reaction
 was everyone just like ‚Äòwoah‚Äô
 everyone was like IAN YOU DOG
 and Ian was like "guys that was an accident how do I delete it"
 Ôøº
 Lol skrrrt
 great chat
 lol
 I saw Ben Ray the other night
 did i already say
 when he visited jake?
 yeah
 ya both of u told me
 It was like a week ago
 yes
 jake‚Äôs constantly comparing his gym performance to him
 lol that night we ran into a palestinian kid
 he had a fucking head scarf on
 I almost shit myself when he came up to us
 I don't think any terrorist in America has ever worn a head scarf
 That'd kinda draw attention to yourself
 I was not thinking straight
 Ôøº
 we hit a 16 wheeler on the way home from brooklyn
 what am I looking at
 them looking at the damage
 crazy times with the class of 2016!!
 must‚Äôve just been a dent
 nah some peeled back metal
 Scared the shit out of me
 It was on my side
 whose fault was it
 bens
 completely
 btw why are you texting sigman
 what u mean
 like why do you still talk to her
 she texted me
 ab iOS 8
 classic
 classic reason to text phil bernstein
 lol
 should‚Äôve sent her a keystroke logger
 I told her I don't help people who remove me from snapchat
 And then she sent me that selfie
 funny thing about sigman:
 she‚Äôs a bit of a social climber
 who isn't lol
 she just takes it to an extreme
 a blatant extreme
 she is a sad girl tho
 the shit she tweets on her other Twitter
 makes my cold heart grow three sizes
 hahahahah
 phil if I were you I wouldn‚Äôt even give this girl the time of day
 lol
 i hooked up w the girl she tried to social climb from dozens of times
 who
 ....
 must be LaRoux
 yea clearly
 who tf is in that grade..
 Omfg it's annie
 jesus fucking Christ
 she's so bad at social climbing holy fuck
 she only goes down
 her friend group is like sabina now
 oh
 you think I give two shits about that clique
 on spanish guys
 LOL
 lol she got rejected by her prom date
 she tweeted ab it on the other Twitter :/
 phil
 who caressssss
 I do it's so entertaining
 is it entertaining or sad
 just bc you‚Äôre going to NCC rn doesn‚Äôt mean you need to hang on to high school!
 do you swear to god you won't screenshot my next snapchat
 and no taking pictures of the screen
 ugh so tempting
 but yes I swear I won‚Äôt
 I don‚Äôt carry a nikon around...
 I sent it
 LOL
 my exact sentiments
 eh
 the context is hot
 kinda looked like she has hair on her chest
 Lmao
 That's head hair
 maybe it was a shadow
 no i mean in between
 Shadow
 I have the high res edition
 HAHAHAHAH
 That lasts for more than 1 second
 Lol
 He'd get so upset
 She threw her phone at the ground and broke it after this
 I'd be so mortified
 if you have one of your meetings with Ian
 and bring in your laptop with the HD pic as your background
 LOL
 what a fucking idiot
 both the action and reaction
 yeah me too
 if my tits looked like that
 jk she looks fine
 I don‚Äôt even understand how it happened....
 how do you accidentally do that
 how's school
 ÔøºFun
 Sick tv
 It was free
 So is AIDS
 Not true
 It costs 0$ to have aids
 But getting it will cost ya
 same w having a shitty tv
 It's not even my room lol
 They found it on the sidewalk
 so help ur friend out and throw it out the widow
 not a typo
 find a widow n throw it at her
 How bored are ya Phil
 I'm ab to work out
 this is me procrastinating
 not being bored
 Mhm
 Crunches downstairs?
 Or gonna visit the NCC powerlifting emporium
 nah doin the bench
 Nice
 And just looked at pics of Hannah fagen and traded stories
 I saw molly ln
 Did she lick your butthole
 She rlly wants to fuck Mikey Froccaro
 Idk what her deal is
 Because he's ripped and Italian
 Lol
 "I could never date a Jew"
 - him
 Hahahahahha
 Happy rosh hashanah btw
 we didn't celebrate this year
 We changed it to rosh hannah
 Lol
 How much do u bench
 lol
 tn I did 165 but I switch it up a lot
 didn't have a spotter tn
 Mhm
 Big weight
 not rly
 That question typically means "what is your 1RM"
 some days I'm significantly weaker than other days
 Hm
 don't know
 I've never just done one rep
 If you can do 10 reps of 155
  5 of 165
 Follow the trend
 I don't usually do it like that
 I just slowly shift up weight and do the same # of reps
 That's like the opposite of a drop set
 ya I usually stop at failure
 Whatever floats ur canoe
 I don't wanna fail then drop then fail
 Id do that w a spotter
 You can do more at the beginning of the workout
 ya
 obviously
 Did u actually teach yourself pointers and shit
 by that what do you mean
 "Teaching yourself pointers"
 Is a pretty ambiguous statement lol
 How
 did I teach myself how to use pointers
 Did you teach yourself how to refer to an address in memory
 how assembly works
 And pass that as a parameter
 like how low level r u talking
 there is not rly teaching yourself
 did I learn it in a class
 No
 Did the knowledge appear in my brain after staring at a blank class file
 No
 I read books
 Ok why do you always do that
 I didn't say "did you absorb the knowledge of coding from the USB in your dick"
 lol
 there's so much info ab pointers to know
 Ok but by yourself
 You were able to take **argv
 And break it down into its constituent command line arguments
 lol with a book yes
 a book is the same shit as class
 idk why that's learning it by myself
 Idk how it's not
 You took it upon yourself to read it
 How you got the willpower to do it I don't know
 I started back in like 9th grade
 we had a summer house that I was forced to live at and I didn't know anyone up there
 And I wanted a macbook
 So I tried to learn how to make apps for webos
 that's where the willpower came from
 I wish I was that bored
 i do too
 now that I have things to do its so annoying to learn things
 programming kinda always clicked in my brain tho idk it's funny bc im retarded w most other things
 Yeah like how were you not in calc bc
 well i was a first kid born to parents who weren't that into being a perfect student
 I don't think I even took the advanced math test
 my brother and sisters are
 You mean they didn't push you?
 ya it wasn't rlly a big deal
 now they're tiger parents w the rest of the kids
 Lol
 You set the bar too high
 lol
 Right
 Yeah actually
 not at all lol
 I was so bad in school
 Who gives a fuck
 You're farther ahead than everyone
 lol life's not a race
 Lol ok
 Everyone compares themselves to everyone else based on milestones
 lol I guess
 you go to Columbia which has a competitive culture too
 Yeah so like 3 people got an internship at google/fb/twitter this summer
 Two were girls do it didn't count
 that's actually true
 Everyone else is mostly struggling to catch up
 Yeah I'm not kidding
 Girls in engineering have ridiculous favoritism
 it's insane
 Total affirmative action
 like Google CSSI
 LITERALLY only lets in girls and minorities
 it's more important to get an internship than where it is
 the job market for engineers is unreal
 unemployment doesn't exist
 I get emails literally every day trying to recruit
 üòí
 why is that an eye roll
 use angel list
 Bc you're bragging
 for next summer
 not at all lol
 What's that
 I'm saying if you list software engineer
 On your career you will get recruitment emails every day
 and angel.co
 it's like a job browsing service for startups
 it's like tinder for startup jobs lol
 It's the yikyak of LinkedIn
 The Venmo of what's app
 I do it for ego boost
 Just see which companies I match w
 Would you actually take some of them if you could
 Ôøº
 idk probably not
 I won't find a boss who puts up w my shit like my current one
 "Bernstein you're a rogue coder but dammit we need ya"
 lol
 he just doesn't care ab anything
 as long as work is done
 omfg
 Richard Branson's show
 Is so bad
 Idek what that is
 But he and John McAffe are the biggest try harder
 *tryhards
 How is Nassau Connect going
 Lol
 Fuck you
 You know how annoying that is
 I think I can one up you on the obnoxiousness scale
 r u actually curious
 I made it in a really weird way
 http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000313153
 Yeah I was!
 it's a WebKit engine in the background
 Instead of using any REST services directly
 Bc I didn't feel like sniffing out the API lol
 whatchu scraping
 scrapers always break
 life lessons
 hah uhhhh
 i‚Äôm gonna make my very first scraper this week
 üòä
 data on courses
 from the directory
 yeah i‚Äôm supposed to fix a broken one
 which is going to be ‚Äútemporary‚Äù
 we‚Äôre going to try and get the school to give us the info directly
 but what I really want to do is heuristics
 for suggesting classes that people might want to take
 can u send me
 the info
 for the fake id guy
 http://misterreplicator.ws/
 you‚Äôre
 wel
 come
 than
 k you
 he‚Äôs on vacation btw
 for how long
 n how much is it
 idk
 and $125
 how long does it usually take
 hey phil
 n why does he say "to get started send 1btc to..."
 he has a FAQ
 and I really don‚Äôt know why
 his lack of punctuation always confuses me
 you really wanna go to the clubs with ian and juj huh
 lol they're not rly the clubbing types lol
 esp Juliette...
 I don't pee w them either
 ok the key word was ‚Äúgo‚Äù rather than ‚Äúclubs‚Äù
 just woke up my roommate laughing
 doubtful
 Yeah he doesn't sleep this early
 Ôøº
 Ôøº
 Ôøº
 Ôøº
 Ôøº
 Ôøº
 who was the first one
 Ôøº
 That is Aaron Brezel
 Ohhhh Jamie's bud
 Yeeaaahhh
 tom can't make that face after getting his dick grabbed
 after all the times he's thrown his dick at people
 meat cushions
 Tom is allowed to do whatever he wants because no one is allowed to question his masculinity
 Ôøº
 3 yrs old
 where‚Äôs that pic of cal when he was going crazy in my kitchen
 ik u have it
 ÔøºOfficially A Real Hacker Now
 lol
 ok something about your John Meyer theory doesn‚Äôt quite add up
 I figured it out
 It's for thiel
 fellowship
 oh
 he's frontin so he gets coverage
 And the 100k
 bc applications just opened lol
 ooook
 because you said that Apple wasn‚Äôt going to like the fact that he was going to fail out
 even though he mentioned it publicly
 and then he talks about how Apple said he could come back if he wanted
 Doubt it
 He went last yr and made finals
 But w the same idea
 but didn't win
 do you think he‚Äôs going to get it?
 but he didn‚Äôt have as much of a presence
 ya
 Thiel is hard
 Rly hard
 His story is perfect tho
 yeah
 it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs trying to live out the mission statement
 ‚ÄúSome ideas just can‚Äôt wait‚Äù
 he‚Äôs just been saying everything they want to hear
 sneaky bastard
 lol
 phil quick
 ya
 give me something to talk about w the cute peruvian girl in Operating Systems across from me
 something technical
 yes
 talk ab the net link bios shell in ubuntu
 That's not real
 Ur not real
 Download trivia crack

 That was Ian
 Eating Wendy's
 On the phone
 I ask you to hang out and you go off with him instead
 Thanks.
 That really pisses me off
 Are you still up?
 Are you up?
 Maybe I would've stayed up if you'd told me what the hell you were doing
 God damnit Ben
 This is all your fault
 We could've explored the world together
 I‚Äôm not going to humor you if you don‚Äôt apologize
 I'm sorry!!!
 Mikey was home

 No I had plans w him since last Thursday
 Was trynna group the two together
 Are you still home
 so why didn‚Äôt you say so

 In retrospect
 I should've kept talking to them
 The hot one was telling me all ab tickets n shit
 N SHE STARTED THE CONVO

 They thought my dad like owned the fuckingn theatre
 i was just remembering how hot the girls were

 no phone numbers
 they legit thought he owned it
 Bc I said his company owned it
 N he kept showing up out of nowhere
 And we talked ab benign rich
 she was definitely under 16

 at least you flaunt your wealth in subtle ways
 buying a seat six rows from the front but sitting two rows closer

 Nothing
 Is this a female "nothing" or a real nothing
 a real nothing lol
 What's up

 turning up at columbia is a privilege
 and if there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned so far it‚Äôs to check my privilege
 I‚Äôve been turnt for the past couple of days

 Didn't give a date tho
 It's at his old house I think
 Bc it's vacant
 Actually idk
 He said new house I thought
 Bc they aren't living there
 Yet?
 Yeah that makes sense
 The way he said it made me think it was a real estate investment
 Not a new house
 party central
 Speaking of real estate
 It looks like I'll have a place in the city soon
 Near Lincoln center
 Your parents moving
 Or you
 Nah they're just getting a timeshare or something
 Since apparently they're in the city like 20x a month
 Ohh a love nest
 Kinky

 Okay you're on
 Play me bitch
 How close r u to the Bronx
 I'm at 116th
 Is that close
 Lol do you know where the Bronx starts

 The Harlem river
 So that's close
 I'd have to go to like 145th and 6th avenue
 Why do you ask
 Do we know anyone who goes to Fordham
 Robert Gray
 Other than him
 He doesn't live on campus does he
 No
 Use graph search
 Can someone drop off a package for me
 To you

 So there u go

 No and I'm busy until like 8
 fml
 Do you have a mailbox
 Uhhh yeah

 Okay yeah I was going to ask
 Alright hold on let me canvas

 Alright I guess it doesn't matter
 How big is it
 Misdemeanor quantity

 Found a guy

 Ôøº
 Yes Phil
 It's like 300$ worth of drugs
 He won't take any
 Uhh where can they meet up...
 I might just have them do it another day
 Middle of 113th should be good
 too much effort
 Why
 They just drive down and drop it off
 ya but involving random people
 lol
 He's just one guy
 He can just walk in and keep it in his room
 It's not weed tho
 I assume it's in a clandestine bag
 Yeah I got that from the "not smelly" part
 How is ur friend ok w that
 Bc we go to Columbia
 We regularly take shit from the school
 What shit
 TVs and monitors
 Do you want to do it later with just me?
 This is
 150mg of Xanax
 Omfg it's not even narcotics

 I don't know you any more
 You could be anything
 Ok let's do this
 Alright when should I tell him to wait
 And what should he wait for
 Let me set it up
 Do you want his number
 I'm setting it up first
 Alright well you let me know and I'll relay it to him
 And I'll be free at 4:00 if you'd rather do that

 wtf
 oh family
 lol
 never saw that one coming!
 yes
 bc u pick her up all the time and she thinks ur funny
 why else would she hang out so much
 idk I usually attract friends
 I didn't expect her to like me
 I mean you show a girl like that enough attention and it‚Äôs bound to happen
 Don't tell Tom
 okay?
 is he going to give you shit for it
 I love the kid but
 He's fucking crazy
 I don't want him fucking this up for me
 neither was annie she was gross
 lol
 I feel like she isn‚Äôt exactly out of ur league
 lol OK phil
 I just like this girl
 annie was cute but
 half of her hotness was the fact that she'd
 wow
 don‚Äôt say it
 about tom
 Fuck ur brains out in 5m
 ?
 oh nvm
 I totally mispredicted where that sentence was going
 I‚Äôm pretty sure tom isn‚Äôt going for her so idk how he could fuck it up
 no not like that
 He just has no line
 He told annie I was in love w her
 That kind of shit
 nowhere
 This was after we were hooking up

 phil why the fuck do you even talk to her
 I just heard thru Michela
 Bc it's Michelas best friend
 It took me so long to get her past that
 Just now
 not my fault

 Annie has no bearing on my life

 The hotel?
 Long stay

 Well that's just the tip of the iceberg
 Not just with me

 or go to RadioShack and get one for 3.99
 Oh
 I have a ton in use
 I don have like a ton lying around
 whenever you want to bump your jams
 wait can I have a couple lol
 okay well I ordered like 6 for 1.79 each
 lol
 you mislead me
 1.79 aux cords r gonna make u rlly understand how cables work
 1.79 cables prolly aren't shielded
 u fnna be picking up 92.3 when there's nothin plugged in
 what does that mean
 should I have bought 9.99 monster cables with gold tips
 http://www.amazon.com/eForCity-3-5MM-AUXILIARY-Compatible-iPhone%C2%AE/dp/B002SOZ5RY/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1421122276&sr=8-6&keywords=auxiliary+cable
 oh yea
 what are you using it for
 I like how the reviews say bad quality but like
 w digital audio
 There are no varying degrees
 Of quality
 No they said sound
 my car
 so you can play ur crazy good jams
 about the cable, not the sound
 they probably plugged one end into their air
 ear
 i bet it‚Äôll be hunky dory
 do uk anyone who needs mdma
 not right now
 maybe next week at school
 aight I'll hold onto it
 I bought the smallest quantity possible I just don't need like any of it
 2 doses left
 alright but I don‚Äôt really want to be asking around
 feels weird
 LOL don't
 You just asked last week
 just lmk if someone asks
 people need itall the time
 I'm not in a rush
 I just don't wanna be a drug dealer
 I just don't want these drugs
 that was for NYE lol

 Yea here's his # 4911383

 That was a dramatic representation
 Of what ur role would be
 okay you should‚Äôve prefaced that‚Ä¶
 lmao
 or at least use quotes
 do u rly
 dangerous thing to be a distributor of
 UR hard core
 anyway I know a distributor
 yes
 uh huh
 he seems like a nice enough guy
 w a kapital kore
 just like that hispanic uncle who met me at chipotle
 nice fellow
 lmao
 iMessage is end to end encrypted too
 perhaps we should be discussing this over wickr
 Unless ur moving some weapons U should be good
 so yeah about that m4 u wanted
 does it have the silver rims?
 and the air inducts
 it has an engraving on the barrel that says ‚Äúallahu ackbar‚Äù
 I want the bmw logo etched off
 also want the convertible
 Hey Ben
 Hey hun
 sup
 Just got my male to male cord
 We should all hang before school
 Just saw arjuna
 Sure!
 Who is all
 yeezus
 We seem to be getting along well
 I agree
 what have you been up to
 Intern apps/learning obj-c
 objc is cake
 did that guy ship?
 It's out of my hands now Phil
 I approved the proofs
 no IK jw if he said he shipped
 I just got drugs in the mail
 They packaged it like vitamins
 Yummy
 He does it like baseball cards
 Ôøº
 Haha $0.00
 Do we wanna meet up tn?
 Tom does
 & do what
 Idk hang out
 is ur house open
 nah
 we don't have to like get drunk
 yeah but it‚Äôs nice to hang out without supervision
 yea I gues
 my whole fams home
 isn't UR basement kinda private?
 tom can yell nigger if he wants to
 kiiiinda
 yeah
 that works
 so who else can we wrangle
 benny seems yeezus-averse but maybe he could be coaxed out
 cal/arjuna would be good
 Nathan seems ok
 yeah
 and that‚Äôs it
 Jwass?
 Lmao
 oh yeah
 as long as he only brings two tins with him at most
 So is everyone on board in the group
 cal tom you
 Just got Arjuna
 nice
 I saw juna
 Yes you told me
 Ya I knew I told someone
 Took those multivitamins already huh
 Thought it was tom
 Lol those are for Friday
 which U should come to
 Is that the big hallucinogen extravanganza
 It's just Molly
 Not a hallucinogen
 Are you doing it at a concert or something
 Ya Dillon Francis
 Come if you'd like
 Hmmm
 chance to really meet Michela
 Pregame in our hotel room
 roll w us
 possible 3 way
 you, me, and ian?
 Michela

 You need anything from PC
 Gonna head there before I come over
 Port convenience
 lmk
 how the benadryl goes
 it makes u real sleepy
 takes like 40 for full
 but it'll knock u out
 sleep until an alarm basically
 UR gonna feel groggy when u wake up just take a shower and it'll go away
 I‚Äôm kinda feeling it
 i took it about 20 mins ago
 do i sleep long or deep
 or oth
 both
 yes sir
 I'm benadryls biggest proponent
 Thanks for having us over!
 Went relatively well
 we're gettin old
 mostly it's that half of us just take shit now and don't care
 when you going back?
 like 3 days or 10
 I'm not worried
 Ab getting it
 It'd just be nice to get it before the 21st
 I'll mail his to him
 You‚Äôre welcome
 I was gonna say so as well
 bouts of contained violence
 illicit substances
 nothing too bad
 yup
 next monday
 you‚Äôre def getting your ID don‚Äôt worry
 Tom I‚Äôm worried about
 I'm comfortable w that
 hahah ok
 idk if he will
 don‚Äôt they search mail
 You can't open a usps parcel without a federal warrant
 So they'd have to be pretty fucking sure there's a fake ID inside
 And be wasting their time on that
 That's why drugs go by usps
 god bless america
 Bc the gov can open ups etc way easier
 the stealth is usually so if
 The envelope breaks open or something
 it isn't a whole big deal
 or if someone else opens it in your home
 just a word of advice
 lol
 If usps ever asks for a signature and you're expecting drugs to come
 Do not sign
 Or fake ids
 yeah we talked about this at will‚Äôs
 oh good
 alright so it‚Äôs probably going to come when I‚Äôm in school
 but here‚Äôs the plan
 I‚Äôm going to ‚Äúleave‚Äù something at home
 then pick it up next weekend
 Just tell your mom I'll bring it to you
 even
 better
 and I'll grab it
 n end of story
 by Monday do you mean like
 A few days from now
 MLK day
 yes
 dam classes start that early?
 tuesday
 Or you going in early
 yup
 we should all meet up one last time
 so that we can leave it on a sour note
 no that‚Äôs late
 with fakes
 hahaha
 didn't get the chance tn!!!
 then we can all have an excuse not to talk to each other and do something productive
 exactly
 I think cal has ED
 he really wanted that viagra
 Ya I don't think he
 Understands Viagra
 I think he thinks it makes UR dick bigger
 Or he might just get really nervous w sex
 Happened to me at least once
 yeah same
 which is alright for continuous things
 Ya sucks for one nighters
 exactly
 I keep some Viagra just in case
 do u actually want
 esp bc you‚Äôre drunk
 yo‚Ä¶hook me up pls
 yes
 lmao ok I'll get some more
 I'll just get it prescribed next week
 Tell him zoloft is fucking w my homers
 Boners
 damn this psychiatrist really sets you up
 All of them do
 That's the point
 Of a psychiatrist
 You have to go in like once every month or two so he can see you're still
 Doing well
 And not a crack addict
 quite a commitment
 you know how to play the game
 well the key is to
 describe the symptoms not the disease
 If you want xanax don't say I'm having panic attacks
 Say I can't breath and my heart beats really fast
 Literally all it takes
 If u go in asking for xanax UR gonna get shut down
 hustler
 and it‚Äôs all between you and him right
 nah I don't RLY take advantage of it
 And yeah confidentiality
 Im only prescribed my anti depressant and Klonopin
 Both I use as described
 Prescribed
 ahhh
 You would do well w Klonopin
 for anxiety huh
 you think I‚Äôm anxious????
 omg why would you think that
 Everyone is
 omg
 does everyone think that
 That feeling you get when you want to talk to a hot girl
 But can't
 It dims that a lot
 is this your flirtation device
 attached to both arms
 I mean it helps a lot
 I'll let u try it once
 It's not what u think it is
 sort of?
 like it takes the edge off of stress
 Hmmmm
 does it mellow you out
 it doesn't make u a vegetable
 I barely notice the effects anymore
 But if I stop taking it anxiety comes back
 uh oh
 so these prescriptions do have lasting side effects
 no I mean
 I go back to my old level
 I used to not be able to go to parties
 And be comfortable
 Now I am
 Idk it's just a cool drug
 And also very easily abusable
 But id advise against it
 Lol
 It's chemically so similar to xanax
 It just has a half life of 18-38 hours
 Compared to 3
 makes you cool huh
 buellerzepam
 so u take it when u wanna sleep
 It knocks u out
 Then u don't hve anxiety all day
 I'm awful at falling asleep
 I only really take Klonopin
 I take xanax once in a while
 And by once in a while I mean
 it seems like a lot of these things you take are BZDs?
 When people take too much of my Klonopin and I run out early
 I don't really take it to get barred out like cal and pals do
 That's why they paid 7$ each
 It's hip
 It's getting drunk in a pill
 without a hangover
 So college kids do it
 meh i thought it would be
 I haven't upped my dose
 Lol it's not mood
 Having a lot of anxiety is a chemical problem
 so u fix it w chemicals
 if u don't get a lot of anxiety don't take it
 ya no people who take bars all the time
 Are really dumb
 this seems like a shaky road
 moderating your mood with drugs
 yeah I get that
 but abusing it
 or just using it because you feel like you should
 It's one of the few drugs that when abused
 Withdrawal can kill you
 I'm not talking ab therapeutic dose withdrawal
 People who abuse it extremely have like seizures coming off it
 which is what it‚Äôs supposed to treat, right
 well that's one
 thing it treats
 Bc it can relax muscles
 Doesn't effect gains i googled it
 I was curious!!!! Not a joke
 I googled it months ago
 When I lifted every day
 you know
 maybe if tom stopped eating all those nuggets
 he‚Äôd have abs by now
 jake goes way more diligently than I
 hence why he treasures my quips
 he has a gf too
 because I deliver them so sparingly
 yes!
 Idk how he gets the motivation
 and he wants to show off to her
 If I was single Id still be lifting more often
 I was talking to Phil sorensen once
 lol that kids nice but
 a total scrub
 they were so gay
 Especially at edc
 I started lifting again tho
 Wanna tone up a lil
 I only lifted Bc of some pipe dream of getting laid
 That I don't
 Are squats legs and lower back
 he was like ‚Äúyeah man I just wanna be really sexy for juliana‚Äù
 mhm
 get those stats up
 you don‚Äôt have a squat rack
 mostly legs
 lower back is deadlift
 I don't do anything lef related
 Leg
 I literally can't
 but your calves dude
 they‚Äôre massive
 My legs are already so big
 all that jumping around at EDC
 It'd be an inconvenience
 To be bigger
 Calves are like 90% genetics
 I've said this
 more like
 Doctor why are my calves ripped
 Expert phil
 IK random things Bc when I get bored at work I start reading a Wikipedia article
 Then keep reading ones related
 For like an hour a day
 no it's fun
 I get my work doe
 Done
 N I don't get paid by the hour
 So I'm just hurting myself lol
 Fitness Expert Phil
 personal trainer to the stars
 doctor doctor can‚Äôt you see
 My calves are so big long pants are small on me
 sounds like someone could use a little
 medicatioonnnn
 that‚Äôs trueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
 I‚Äôm fading
 me too
 Gn pal hope to see you soon
 my heart feels a little weird
 well u took the therapeutic dose
 so relax
 oh adderall
 U took like no adderall
 You'll still get knocked out
 Your eyes get heavy
 Your mind wanders
 that's fun
 I've been like 172 for like 2 years
 Even when I get fatter
 Or lose weight
 It's still a really similar weight
 I guess i gain muscle when I lose weight
 that's what I do
 before and after shit
 so I can tell how much it weighed
 tense
 I‚Äôm lightweight baby!!
 guess how much I‚Äôm down to
 don‚Äôt tell any ‚Äúothers‚Äù
 148 lbs
 weigh naked after your morning shit
 true weight
 last question
 what was the most massive
 Benadryl makes UR orgasms insane fyi quick fun fact
 lmao
 yeah tell me about it
 I wish u guys got ticks to friday
 Would've been a grand old time
 you me and dupree
 great cinema
 cal said some kids were doing coke at the freshman nye party
 I can't imagine u w a whole adderall pill
 I want to know who
 prolly wasn't coke
 and I'll find out
 he said some of his ‚Äúboys‚Äù
 which means definitely matt
 Sisters a freshman
 Oh
 That
 Kind of freshman
 lol
 Who cares ab 19 year olds doing blow
 That's like saying a toddler is crying
 yeah but I can‚Äôt imagine arjuna doing it
 alright eyes are drooping
 gn my friend
 gn
 What?
 Im heading over in 5
 NIcr
 I've been working on this shit
 I can‚Äôt believe that you want to work on the exact thing that I was planning on studying
 For 15 months
 is this what you were working on with david tung
 no I'm talking about at work
 It's gonna make sm money
 Ya can
 We should work out cuts
 Before we start
 I think we should split it three ways you me and Ian
 And everyone who puts in money
 Gets a % return
 oh
 right
 yeah you told me about the biometric shit before
 but what about for this side project
 I want to help you build it
 yea sure
 so if someone puts in enough to get 10%
 then us three will get 30%?
 gross is split 33 33 33
 if someone puts in 100$
 And it turns into 200
 They'll get 120
 And we split the rest
 But like idk we all have money
 Idk we'll figure it out
 hah we should‚Ä¶probably figure that out sooner than later
 but alright
 so we‚Äôre basically selling bonds, not equity?
 Ya
 But I don't even wanna sell bonds
 I'll figure it out
 I'll draft it up
 well alright
 do you envision ever going seed funding
 I have like 25k in cash
 I don't think we need more
 To get started
 I'd rather not owe money
 oh yeah
 We don't need money rn anyway
 We can prove it works w.o actually buying the ticket
 Run simulations
 Once we beat the game we use real money
 monte carlo
 alright
 just gotta get a prototype
 There's like 4 or 5 steps
 First prototype is sellout prediction
 Most important
 If a show doesn't sell out it won't sell above sticker
 If we get that at like
 90% accuracy
 we win
 if a show doesn‚Äôt sell out then the resale price won‚Äôt go above sticker price
 because you could just buy it direct
 is what you‚Äôre saying
 ?
 yes exactly
 You'd sell it slightly below retail
 Lose a couple dollars
 Not the whole investment
 there's very little
 room for loss
 if done right
 right
 we can use seatgeek data to figure out which area of the venue sells for the most money
 ahhh hah
 everything you‚Äôve been talking about is slowly coming into place
 did I tell you about my site?
 That I want to make
 no
 So I want to make a site
 That resells tickets
 But when you buy
 It does a ticketmaster transfer
 You don't just get the pdf
 Full security for the consumer
 We avoid stubhub fees
 and the ticket would be listed on the site at the peak sale price
 what is a ‚Äúticketmaster transfer‚Äù
 it basically destroys the old ticket
 makes a new one and puts it in their account
 no risk of duplicates being sold
 full consumer confidence
 then the site lists the ticket for 2-3% less than stubhub
 at the right time
 And I want to convince seatgeek to aggregate us
 And they do 18m a month in sales
 I know the founders
 Not well
 But well enough for a sit down
 Essentially we'd only sell at peak ticket price
 But we'd still be the cheapest option
 yes
 so expensive, but not as expensive as stub hub
 well write algorithms to figure out how to price when to list etc
 It'll know what to do in every scenario
 Fully automated
 so is there some kind of information asymmetry with regard to ticket prices
 What do you mean?
 if I wanted to buy a ticket late
 is there not something that exists that compares all the resale site prices
 two days ago tickets were 75
 Yesterday they were 135
 Today they're 90
 Oh
 Seatgeek aggregates
 All sites
 We'd always show up as the cheapest
 a lot of reasons
 it's a commodity
 value fluctuates
 It is perfect competition
 perfect competition doesn't mean no third party profit
 one direction tickets start out at 50$
 right
 so why doesn‚Äôt that create perfect competition
 Then sell for 400 4 weeks later
 And with computers we'd have access to every presage
 Presage
 The second it opens
 I have citi and Alex's
 Amex
 So wel have access to those presales too
 there shouldn't be response by vendors
 software will look like people
 yep
 yep
 what do you envision as some obstacles that might arise
 e.g. response by the vendors
 automated turks eh
 and that‚Äôs legal?
 sweet
 I want to patent the two main algorithms
 well I‚Äôll leave you to that
 well
 we have a patent attorney
 how
 my dad
 is that
 Lol
 what is he other times
 lucky you
 My dad‚Äôs a VC ‚Ä¶ sometimes
 idk just a plain old investor
 listens to his analysts and decides where people‚Äôs money should go
 Have you fucked around w Robin Hood yet
 Hve I asked u this yet
 also UR dad should give us some seed capital
 once we beat the game in theory
 answer first q
 second q doesn't matter
 It's commission free stock trading
 So you can just buy stocks and shit
 W no fees
 lol
 one step at a time
 no I have not
 but I‚Äùm downloading it rn
 ik
 it's pretty cool
 I've lost 15$
 I got aapl at 120 and now it's like 700
 So in the end I win
 It split 7 ways
 It's like 111 but I have 7x the shares
 I bought 8 shares of nike in 2008
 Now it's 18 shares
 And 50% higher each share
 My grandma is a genius
 I can never win
 Not patient enough I guess
 hahah
 bundle of fun
 I heard tesla‚Äôs low
 I‚Äôll pick some up
 omfg I told my dad to buy it in like 2005
 yeah I know now it‚Äôs like 115
 yup
 gotta go in for the long haul
 Ya I've had aapl since
 2007
 Probably won't sell until I buy a house
 Oh I can

 Ya
 I left w mikey and nick an hour ago
 oh word
 like
 15m after me
 lol
 who the fuck is nick
 nick gardella?
 oh
 right
 lol
 I just googled my dad bc when you asked I realized I really don‚Äôt know exactly what he does
 and apparently that‚Äôs because he loves listing ‚Äúother‚Äù as his role
 Lol
 He sounds like
 An investment banker
 Ôøºyeah he‚Äôs an investment anaylist
 we Lerners stay out of the spotlight
 same
 the Meyers like the spotlight
 WHO KNEW? NEW NEWS!
 Idk how he talks ab money
 It makes me so uncomfortable
 nah
 lol
 I'm pretty
 frugal
 lol
 you‚Äôll grow into it
 soon you‚Äôll be like that dan blizzard guy on instagram
 I already agreed before you said ‚Äúfrugal‚Äù
 ;*
 I am too in case you haven‚Äôt noticed
 lmao
 I yell at my mom for buying laptops because she doesn‚Äôt feel like getting up
 I only spend money on
 Michela
 And that's slowing down
 Bc she hates it
 what‚Äôs the nicest thing you bought her
 Tiffanys necklace
 that's not that woe
 Wow
 It was Christmas
 the real money is
 if I may ask
 wooooowwwww!!!!
 almost as good as when leif tied a blade of grass around ellie‚Äôs finger
 food and events
 ‚Äúevents‚Äù
 soirees
 hootenannies
 lol
 Like the hotel tm
 For example
 worth it
 ya every once in a while
 the basement in my house is two floors below the sleeping area
 no one can hear shit
 plus she like shoves her face in a pillow
 tmi?
 both really
 we can't RLY be loud w the fam home....
 on her back or stomach
 well on the back seems like she‚Äôs playing peekaboo
 hotel was cheap
 you get good deals this time of year
 lmao
 Doesn't work but
 I know you're kidding
 all about the deals huh
 buy low sell high
 why don‚Äôt we get into the hotel reservation reselling business
 Ah well
 fuck i wanna work on this shit
 Same!!!
 I can see 6 figures
 You hyped me up
 Hahaha
 The hearts in your eyes
 they've become dollar signs
 I'm usually not wrong
 I abandon projects I think will fail
 Phil I have faith in you
 it's just gonna be a month of actual work
 but I'm pumped
 gonna have to start a sprint
 I feel like you're hyped up on whatever you did on jakes countertop
 But even so
 nah I've been on this project for days
 The opportunity is real
 What's Ian's role
 Jw
 he and I basically invented it
 we came up w the logistics
 he has less of a tech role
 But he's done a lot of experimenting
 W ticket sales
 The past couple weeks
 And has been winning
 And he's very charismatic
 if u mean classically good looking sure
 I'm sure he'll make a great pitch to my dad
 he's a good
 Good
 You should see my vimrc
 decked out with macros
 Goof
 I'd make a better pitch tbh
 Yes you would
 Ian wouldn't really understand the tech
 That's why I have trouble working w David and Ian
 It's just me working
 And then complaining
 Them*
 Those days are soon over
 I'll be knee deep in the silicon
 Are ya actually studying this shit no wb
 Now?*
 I remember over the summer you didn't know much ab machine learning
 Well the stat class I'm taking is relevant
 Lol a lot has changed
 Ya I suck at stats
 is that a euphemism
 ??
 do you have a point scale
 what are you talking about
 mg scale
 keyboard macros
 not macronutrients
 no IK im just looking at my molly
 And realizing I have no way to measure
 we could do freaks and geeks style
 Probably need to go buy one
 break into the HS chemistry lab
 I have a .x5 scale
 I want a .xxx scale
 can‚Äôt say I have any of those
 can't say most people would
 Need it for the xanax gummy bears anyway
 ya alprazolam is soluble in ethanol
 so you just mix that in w the gelatin mix
 and make gummy bears
 harder to get caught too
 so are you using gummy bears as a substrate instead of pills
 do they smell like anything
 Nah xanax has no scent
 I want to get gummy bear bags printed and seal them
 never get caught
 nice
 better than a pill press
 when‚Äôre you going in for the concert tomorrow
 early why
 I'm checking into the hotel and having sex all day basically
 that‚Äôs lovely
 I hope molly does cal
 They're hooking up tm
 They've agreed in words
 She was like we're gonna hook up right?
 And he was like if you want
 I'm Trynna get her to fuck him but she's
 A scaredy cat
 I still want to grab a meal with you two
 woah woah woah!
 hahah
 S m o o t h
 c r i m i n a l
 can‚Äôt believe she came out and just asked
 scared that he‚Äôs ‚Äútoo hot for her‚Äù
 she likes the affirmation
 I set it all up they both knew they were hooking up
 She just wanted to be weird
 you‚Äôre a great pal to all
 now just give me emma marshall‚Äôs number and work your magic
 someone from yeezus
 Has to achieve molly penetration
 he was like
 weirdly about it
 she was too
 I read their texts
 I can't believe he'd Do that to Benny
 And Nathan
 I thought it was going to be victor until he moved
 he gets soooo weird
 at first you think ‚Äòhe‚Äôs not into her‚Äù and then when she says that shit in my basement
 hahah what
 did he completely throw them under the bus
 he was gonna fuck her
 Right after Benny confessed his love
 And was shut down
 and then what
 BRO CODE
 idk it broke down
 she likes the attention but she's
 Afraid of sex
 She doesn't even blow guys
 Cals gonna over do work and get nothing back
 Well he kinda did
 To Nathan
 she's so undesirable
 we're the only two who haven't cave
 D
 it‚Äôs like israel vs. palestine
 if benny was in the same position he would‚Äôve totally done the same
 i forget the whole timeline
 who even cares
 she‚Äôs just a weird immature slutzky
 she just showed up one day
 in the group
 and I never accepted it
 idk what her deal is
 she enjoys drama around her
 Fun times
 bro code
 is supposed to prevent it
 I think cals fine
 Nathan moved on
 Benny "fucked" a hooker
 Jwass got fat
 lol
 I'm so hyped to roll
 We've been
 Pretty darn good
 lol
 he really got the fat end of the stick
 definitely the most abused
 yeah we‚Äôre all fine
 as long as we can torture someone
 Recently
 could it be because of no nathan
 I noticed that just blowing off toms remarks works
 yeah
 don‚Äôt engage the bully
 He feeds on the butthurt
 also not much left
 To make fun of
 You go to Columbia
 Nathan goes to Cornell
 ya
 Cals skating
 juna goes to UIUC which
 Imho is essentially a public icy
 Ivy
 In terms of recruitment
 which
 it'd be fun
 It's kinda a hike
 you have a  job and gf
 do you actually want to visit him this semester
 arjuna
 it‚Äôs true
 could stop in a fun city in between tho
 gotta be super rich first
 closer than florida
 and more fun that watching victor‚Äôs pug masturbate onto the carpet
 lmao
 He lives in a swamp
 Literally gets chased by iguanas
 you need to start intern hunting
 angel list
 browse
 send some messages
 You can't beat Columbia around here
 And there's prolly only 800 of you
 amtrak would only be a hundred something one way
 yes I know
 I feel like I need to make more stuff
 nah
 I‚Äôve only REALLY done rails backend
 well
 make an app
 for one project
 publish it
 okay well I‚Äôm working on it!!!
 It's real easy
 Lmk if you want any connections
 Go for Google
 Nyc office is real nice
 yes
 I start salivating every time I go to chelsea market
 and it‚Äôs not bc of the thai food
 startups are so good tho
 like grubhub treats them so well
 yeah that‚Äôs on my list
 Any YC graduate
 Should be looked at
 They interview you
 ok but I need to prove that I‚Äôm more than just a pretty ivy!!!
 You tell stories ab what you did
 How u did it
 You don't need to make s slideshow lol
 First job I showed 0 code
 Just got a new offer
 Showed 0 code
 okay but you told them about shit you wrote
 how you designed it
 ya but it doesn't have to be insane
 Just cool
 okay well I need to get something cool out!!
 do you wanna be a rails dev
 They're actually pretty in demand rn
 yeah there was that article from quartz
 maybe??
 No I just browse job listings
 And ruby is always being searched for
 I started doing this stuff in october
 You're applying for an internship not a job
 Being an ivy to brag ab is good enough for a lot of people
 Having *
 alright alright
 don't take less than 25 an hour
 it‚Äôs taking me forever to get through these iOS books
 how did you do it
 you just got really bored and sat down and made stuff
 ya I was bored
 but my brain works well
 w programming
 came pretty quickly
 You'll get good dw
 hah you only have a five year head start
 but I‚Äôm catching up
 Books aren't how u get great tbh
 First year
 Just fuck around
 You prolly caught up to me
 Resume wise
 in terms of‚Ä¶ how much you had done at this point?
 just hireability for internships
 i can fuck around on my terminal
 I can‚Äôt fuck around with web stuff as easily
 fuck around w jacscript
 java script
 like I look at people‚Äôs web crawlers and how they‚Äôre importing java.util.httpsomebullshit
 I woudnt bother learning objc
 and I don‚Äôt know WTF they‚Äôre doing
 They're moving to swift
 Okay well my dev team is using it
 that‚Äôs mostly the reason
 they imported that in what
 a Java file or
 yeah
 Jacascript file
 java
 it was something for scraping subreddits of their images i think
 oh ok just double checking unknew thendifference
 hey it's not condescension
 Idk what you've learned
 You prolly only do have
 Java
 Maybe python
 In class that is
 fuck u
 listen I‚Äôve made the ‚Äúit‚Äôs the difference between grapes and grapefruit‚Äù thing before
 yes
 theres a 1 credit js class
 but it cuts into three classes soooo
 Java and Python are
 Archaic lesson plans
 I think python is good for introducing ideas
 weak typing
 I hated writing stupid meaningless home works in Java
 no memory shit
 well
 gcc has garbage collection for c++/ objective c
 ya p simple
 I just got up to the ARC chapter in my book
 wait gcc complies obj-c?
 llvm now
 Used to be gcc
 ok
 Reference counting doesn't men
 Mean
 You won't have leaks
 You have like a 100mb ram limit
 Any OOL
 what do you think people should learn first
 whaaat no
 get one down and switching is semantics
 they should know what a struct is
 Who should
 everyone
 it builds character
 can be useful
 Get the feeling UR just throwing out buzzwords now tho
 take a mobile dev class
 Take a design class too
 no it‚Äôs how the columbia curriculum is structured
 first you learn java and you don‚Äôt know where anything is
 then you learn C and you learn how a struct is just adjacent pieces of memory
 then C++ brings OOP back and it makes sense
 I like swift
 It's kinda simple
 But a big change
 have you tried Go
 nah
 What is it
 Google‚Äôs language
 they use the := operator
 Hahabmy friend worked on that
 I think
 Matt mcnulty
 damn he got promoted
 Should use his hookups
 I wanted to make a PGP IOS 8 keyboard
 Matt?
 He runs an entire team
 And delivers a keynote at I/O
 which kind of weirds me out
 it supports unicode by default which is cool
 so you can say ‚Äúhello „Åõ„Åæ„ÅÑ‚Äù
 he works there?
 she must be a prodigy
 who is she
 He
 He made enyo
 Which is totally the resson bootstrap exists
 And he made ares
 Completely online Ide
 he sent me the hp tablet
 A year before it came out
 Had to sign an NDA
 and keep it in a safe
 wowza
 pretty impressive
 was that the first competitor to the iPad
 Ya
 My ID is gonna be at your house tomorrow
 Did some research
 elaborate
 Tomorrow or sat
 he did a mailing yesterday
 He only ships priority which is 2-3 days
 what was the one before that
 are you sure? I think that was extra
 at least a week ago
 he only ships first class
 Bc it can't be opened
 ah you‚Äôre right
 Which is 1-3days
 Ish
 before it just said confirmed
 now it says shipped
 yeaaaa buddy
 what time do you get mail
 2-4
 same
 doesn't matter don't need it tn
 don‚Äôt worry I ordered a lot of male-to-male cords
 Tm
 no one will know
 I like how he
 Asks for donations
 wtf where
 All the time
 On reddit
 On posts
 Bc he wants to start making Florida
 But doesn't have the funds
 why would he drop to 75
 Bc economics
 if he does 5x more sales Bc of a discount
 He still makes more money
 why is he always so mad
 he needs to relax
 yeah I guess
 just seems weird to do both at the same time
 because people always ask him the same shit
 people like tom just go on and say ‚Äúhurrrr here‚Äôs my clear text address give me an ID pls‚Äù
 No someone asked for other states Bc Illinois is commonly faked
 And he went nuts
 he‚Äôs weird
 everyone is his ‚Äúbud üòä‚Äù
 alright I think you need your rest for tm
 night
 peace
 I'm not going
 I'm asking for Arjuna #
 (516) 477-2506

 Are you doing that programmatically
 Or hand cutting and paying
 Paying
 Pasting
 I inserted a newline after every semicolon
 But you got rid of the RR =RR || too
 I cropped it out
 also do you know what that means
 Do a find replace all
 Of RR.data.placements
 With just placements
 so take out the [0] and [1] after placements too?
 no
 Keep that
 k done
 add var placements = [[][]]; at the top
 Actually wait
 Don't do that
 Ik what to do
 want me to just send it to you
 Ya email
 Ozetadev@
 me.com?
 Ya
 sent
 got anything?
 a box of pizza and an onion ring
 What's the excuse
 yum!!
 so I‚Äôm leaving a bit early tm
 might be too early for any potential mail
 but rest assured I‚Äôll have my mom forward any packages that come through to you
 for me leaving?
 for mail time
 To me
 ‚ÄúI was planning on seeing Phil this weekend to work on some stuff anyway, just give it to him‚Äù
 Anything I should read up on before I get too bogged down with school stuff?
 machine learning
 neighbors
 neighbors?
 oh and what was that book you said I should read
 I'll gig it to u
 what do you mean ‚Äúneighbors‚Äù
 Nearest nigh it
 Neighbors
 From data
 Sure
 oh
 like djikstra
 ok‚Ä¶?
 so greedy algorithms?
 Google machine learning nearest neighbor
 OH
 knn
 I did this in my python class
 I can do this dw
 I love this shit
 I did non-euclidean distances too
 Ôøº
 Is that enough qualification for you
 A little busy atm
 will you be free later?
 makin some strides
 Yeah later tn
 I'll uptown
 When do you move in w Ian?
 https://github.com/jayshahtx/StubHub-Scraper
 fleekseat.com
 Ozetapps200
 104.237.149.113
 yeah I think it‚Äôs working
 it‚Äôs only done a couple cities but I‚Äôll let you know when it‚Äôs done
 can you send me the output for the cities its done
 the readme says I have to run another script to fix the outputted json
 so just hold tight
 Mkay
 how‚Äôd you come up with ‚Äúfleekseat‚Äù
 it‚Äôs good
 my brother has been saying his hair is "on fleek" for like the last month and I always am like what the fuck does that mean
 so it was in my head
 hahahha it‚Äôs such a froccaro thing to say
 Ya short enough and it rhymes
 but it‚Äôs catchy
 the server says it needs to restart
 do you mind if I do so
 nah don't
 I'll do it later
 you're talking ab when you sign in!
 ?*
 when i ssh yeah
 Ya ignore it
 okkk
 can i at least import my vim settings
 I use nano when I edit text in the terminal anyway
 Which is rare
 email me the json
 if we‚Äôre going to be working in here a lot
 lol
 alright w/e
 what do you want me to look at in here
 okay yeah i‚Äôll do that
 did you want me to look at anything on the server
 if it's a good library
 we want it running on the server
 in /var/www/
 I wanna see what info it gives me tho
 emailed?
 or its done
 alright done
 both
 gimme a sec
 do you have son
 JSON
 do you want me to run this scalpyr thing too
 ?
 i sent you the json
 oh
 its there
 missed it
 ok don‚Äôt run this on the server
 I‚Äôm gonna make some adjustments
 investigate scalpyr tho
 see what info it gives us
 i have webkit rendering ticketmaster
 and pulling a lot of data off of it w/ JS injection
 instead of sniffing out the rest requests
 my problem w the JSON you sent me
 is it doesn‚Äôt include event ID
 which i need to track pricing
 sooo do you want me to try and add that
 if you have time
 I can do it when Michela leaves
 scalper features IDs
 from seat geek
 work well?
 what are the metrics by which to judge this
 venue
 locale
 artist
 Artist id
 Event id
 well you know now that you mention it I‚Äôm not entirely sure what this ID is referring to
 but the venue has a lot of details
 BRB
 timezone
 latitude and longitude
 Does it list all events?
 Like can I get all the events ever
 Somehow
 uhhhhh
 let me try
 yes if you don‚Äôt give the request any arguments then it‚Äôll show them all
 I want all cities
 Or we can target the main ones
 actually no, when I give it no arguments then it gives me places from all over the country
 but the list seems like it‚Äôs less than when I gave it New York as the venue location
 there‚Äôs probably a way to list them all though
 yeah after all StubHub scraper just has an array of city names
 and it only checks those
 so we can just do the mains
 I made a script to scrape a new site
 / have you talked to mama Lerner
 Nice / nothing came / I'll call you at 8:30
 :( hopefully tomorrow
 this guy really knows how to drag a process out
 He never said four days
 Idk where you pulled that out of
 ?
 I'm just going off usps
 You said usps slowest is four
 slowest USPS speed is 4-7
 Ahhh
 7
 Yea
 that's why I figured it'd be today or tomorrow
 It says shipped!
 since when did it say that?
 didn't we pay for the better shipping or no
 No
 damn live and learn
 lern
 ha
 K
 how long has it said shipped tho
 just curious
 Omfg I didn't keep track
 you get a free reprint btw
 It'll get here when it gets here
 Why
 since you referred us
 it's his deal
 he makes u a new copy of ur old ID
 so you hve an extra
 Read ab it on his reddit page
 I don't see anything about that
 I'll find it for you
 when I'm on my comp
 Aiiiight
 I read it like last week tho so it's definitely a thing
 I literally can't understand him
 He apparently does so wel
 But needs a 6k$ loan
 it‚Äôs about budgeting
 like, excise taxes are only for roads
 so maybe he‚Äôs very strict about what money goes where
 I'd be so surprised
 watchin tv
 That was an accident
 that's what they all say
 http://devfe.st ?
 yeah I‚Äôm doing it
 same!!!
 ohhhh shit
 how‚Äôd you hear about it
 it got promoted to my Twitter feed
 guess they're getting better at targeting ads
 Oh wait nvm lol
 I follow an associate professor @ Columbia

 my mom‚Äôs on top of the game
 dw

 what‚Äôd u tell her it is
 so that when i pick it up
 our stories match
 is it a package or a letter
 go with USB solid state
 for our server rack
 even if she knows what that is
 it could come packaged in anything
 yeah that‚Äôd be really nonchalant and low key
 something from ebay
 uhhh well idk how he‚Äôs even gonna package it
 last time it was a flat envelope
 size of a binder
 but thin
 but apparently he changes it up??
 okay fine yeah
 very delicate
 please do not open, susan
 thank you
 lol do u need to say that part
 no
 i‚Äôm kidding
 u should‚Äôve shipped it to my house
 omfgggggggggggg
 they don‚Äôt even open
 no I‚Äôm not talking ab convenience
 I‚Äôm talking about u getting caught
 okay he packages it in such a way
 oh right stealth
 that if it accidentally opens en route
 the cards
 you won‚Äôt get caught

 yeah
 ian got a package of herbal tea
 and we were so confused
 my mom‚Äôll be confused but she won‚Äôt investigate
 hahaha
 and it was professionally packaged

 MDMA
 AWESOME
 best stealth I‚Äôve ever seen
 It come?
 Ok Phil I get that you're stressed but stop asking
 lmao
 :/
 assuming it would've been in your mailbox
 I was a minute ago
 :/
 I'm half convinced it's sitting in a pile of mail in your house
 are you there rn
 yeah it would‚Äôve been
 :\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
 not everyone is you!!!
 u guys get sm mail
 it took me like 10m to confirm it wasn‚Äôt in the box
 meh
 lol you must‚Äôve looked so sketchy
 I‚Äôm reading his reddit and he keeps saying it takes 1-4 days :\
 to ship
 ‚Äúwhile usps site says 1,2,3 day for priority that is hardly ever the case so if ordering priority keep that in mind vs freaking out on me like some have
priority on average takes 3-5 business days for most if there being fast and can take longer if weather or holidays etc‚Äù
 the only options are priority and first class
 to make
 or ship
 link
 ‚Äúif ordering priority‚Äù
 I didn‚Äôt order priority
 first class
 is the faster more expensive option....
 thats 1-3 days max
 hell they‚Äôre both less than 5 days
 he said he only ships priority and first class
 http://www.reddit.com/r/fakeid/comments/2qvray/misterreps_replication_station_now_officially_open/cnp36jq?context=3
 there are actually four options, phil
 Priority mail express
 priority mail
 first class
 andddd
 where?????!!??!
 I‚Äôm pretty sure there were three options
 and I chose the cheapest
 hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
 okay hold on
 let me check for
 can u give me ur sign in
 so i can look at the proofs
 n see when they were added
 the proofs were deleted when I approved the orders
 oh well can i still sign in
 and see whats gucci
 kk hold on
 can I pgp email it to you
 just in case
 get wick
 wickr

 im wafflefart97
 lol

 alright ill sign up
 its so funny how this site has like
 typos
 ‚ÄúRepferrals‚Äù
 I was hoping it was a Mister Replicator pun

 username
 realtrapstuff

 ?
 not lettin me in

 ‚ÄúShipping: USPS First Class Mail (max 1 id) (5)‚Äù
 : }
 I‚Äôm telling u its sitting in ur house
 No way man
 do u remember when
 you had a convo w him
 uhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 like a week ago
 like last monday
 so frustrating
 that would mean it mailed out on monday
 wednesday*
 just fyi I ship USPS priority like 2x a month
 and its never taken more than 3 days
 ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
 when did u go back to school
 monday
 it would've (should've?) been delivered saturday
 you think your mom threw it in your room?
 Idk your rooms not small
 IK does she give them to you
 Or tell u ab them
 can I just reply
 and then just forgotten about it??
 she always notices packages and stuff
 I mean you can go over and peek through my window
 you can email mister rep and ask if he really sent them last week
 give em to me
 in the thread
 yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure he gets those
 and if he doesn‚Äôt reply in a day or so you can PGP email him
 i meant in your convo
 on the site
 yes
 even after its shipped
 I think he still gets notified
 sidenote
 what do you use for crum
 or whatever that thing is that people use for workflow
 with the sticky notes
 let‚Äôs just use trello
 at work we use a really
 fucking expensive site
 that costs like
 1000$ a year per user
 i don‚Äôt even remember what its called bc i haven‚Äôt done scrum in like a year
 nothing
 corporate software is just ridiculous
 its not just scrum tho
 its also a git alternative
 thats worse than git
 don‚Äôt even get me started lmao
 it has a lot of features
 what‚Äôs so good about it
 ok trello is free
 wtf
 how is it like git
 one of them is a sub versioning tool
 that blows absolute ballsack
 i had my own unix server and used git but everyone else had to use it and complained every day
 okay well we have git and we just need online flashcards
 or postits
 w/e
 mr replicator has such an ego
 which makes it really easy to deal w him as long as you know that
 what does that mean
 like just stroke his ego
 and he‚Äôll treat you real well
 oh yeah
 leave a nice review and he‚Äôll give you an extra
 maybe
 i got really nervous
 bc that barzapp thing
 and mrreplicator doesn‚Äôt pass it
 but
 its not available in the store anymore
 it was definitely people
 got 2 star review
 s
 being pissed off that their fakes were ab to be obsolete
 probably
 benjy
 ‚Äú did it not show the date on site as when it was marked shipped?‚Äù
 how do i answer that
 also do u remember how u sent me the proofs
 nvm i screenshotted
 maybe you got an email or something
 ya no the site just says
 status shipped
 no date
 uhh
 no?
 right?
 let me check
 lol no
 I checked that too
 def wed
 yeah
 most likely
 if it doesn‚Äôt come tomorrow something is sus
 since I did it early in the morning
 I think it took about this long last time
 it took more than a full week to arrive at your house?
 yup
 i can‚Äôt think of a single shipping method that works like that other than like a DHL truck
 ‚ÄúGet more for your money with fast domestic service in 1, 2, or 3 business days3 based on where your package starts and where it‚Äôs being sent.‚Äù
 like
 ? ? ?
 I waited so much longer last time
 after he confirmed shipped?
 as in
 from start to finish
 actually I don‚Äôt really know when I sent it
 I just sent my btc and waited
 *when he sent it
 you mean yours?
 yeah
 how long was the total time for yours
 welllll
 remember when bitcoins tanked last year
 yeah
 after the 1000 dollar value
 yeah yeah
 okay I bought in at like‚Ä¶high 500
 lmao
 yeah it was a huge bitch
 it tanked again kind of
 what we sent as 80$
 is now 65$
 did mine and toms ship in the same package?
 I waited until it went back up to like high 400 before I decided to buy more and send them over
 hah
 i don‚Äôt fucking know omg
 ask him
 but like they were done at the same time
 yeah that‚Äôs what i figured
 i remember tom had a delay originally
 but I know only as much as is on the website
 something to do w bitcoin
 that was literally like 20 mins
 oh oh ok
 he seems sussed too
 as in he thinks it should be here
 off he is
 ofc
 okay let me try and see how long it took last time
 let me check my wallet history
 mkay
 what is the funny stealth
 everyone keeps mentioning
 is it just the cards
 yes
 thats not that funny
 just a good idea
 cool phil
 w.e people r boring
 okay this is really random but
 I remember that my mom and dad came and visited me to give me the package on the same day they were about to attend my dad‚Äôs colleague‚Äôs ceremony
 by the italian chamber of commerce
 that happened on may 2nd
 and I paid him on april 21st
 and I think it came a little bit earlier than when they visited
 probably didn‚Äôt ship out the day you paid
 he only recently started shipping so frequently
 idk man
 maybe my mom burned it
 lmao
 maybe the dog ate it
 if its not tomorrow its either
 non delivered
 or
 in your house
 there is 0 situation where usps takes more than 9 days to deliver a package lmao
 l  m a    o
 well I definitely gave him the right address
 lol
 did you not notice this
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fakeid/comments/2k2tdu/misterreplicator_reviews_new/cnw5tbh
 nah i saw it
 but he‚Äôs right
 i checked ur front door
 trust me i did a complete
 surveilance
 http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=zygj8k&s=8#.VMGKxS7F9FQ
 that person who got it yesterday is hot
 well that other guy just got it yesterday
 so it‚Äôll probably be in tomorrow
 also there‚Äôs a slight possibility that it might have been at my front door
 but DONT go check now
 where tf did this come from
 I‚Äôm trying to figure out where she lives
 oh you clicked on her profile
 http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=287nfvb&s=8#.VJix4AAU eh
 so i can figure out how this shipping works
 gonna triangulate him
 yeah yeah sure sure that‚Äôs why
 i think she goes to tulane
 no
 its a college town where the majority of students
 are from the east coast
 hm
 she def shipped earlier
 she ordered it before ours i think
 she got her proofs 18 days ago
 how did u
 deduce that
 most people at berkeley are
 from the west coast
 seeing as its
 a western coast
 well
 me
 namely
 I think she goes to berkeley
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fakeid/comments/2qox6m/dealing_with_a_really_strict_college_town/cn8l0wu?context=3

 how is that at all news
 Ha Ha how
 And why is she in NYC
 that's a big deal
 kicked out as an athlete
 that probably takes 2 semesters of fuck up
 but like lower than a 2
 by ‚Äútown‚Äù I meant ‚Äúmy city neighborhood‚Äù
 no she got kicked out
 lol
 by being a fucking retard
 and refusing to turn in any papers
 yup
 that‚Äôs exactly what it took
 hey man
 she‚Äôs a free spirit
 Colombia doesn't do track scholarships does it
 Not full like all other schools tho
 I thought ivys didn't do full
 it probably does
 I don‚Äôt know anything relating to being a minority or an athlete
 yeah nah
 did you fuck or just lay naked together
 bc I just finished round 4 and my legs hurt
 leg day right there
 alright ready
 I come in, the lights are off
 air mattress
 l o l
 did u get blue balled
 U GOT BLUE BALLED
 U BASTARD
 she‚Äôs like ‚Äúcome look at my stuffed dog‚Äù and then pulls me on top of her air mattress
 then she plays trivia crack on top of me for like a minute before the girl whose room she‚Äôs staying in comes back
 and they start talking about her boyfriend
 yeah I mean I know she‚Äôs a tease
 so I didn‚Äôt even build up much anticipation
 I knew there was going to be some bullshit
 been there done that
 oh sick you'll get blue balled twice in a week
 ROOSH V
 however there seems to be trouble on the horizon
 something about ‚Äúwanting to be free this weekend‚Äù
 so‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll see
 Tip #292: If her name is garden, then treat her like dirt
 #TFM
 is #291 treat her like an angel and pretend to be ok w getting all revved up for no reason
 u housed her for a weekend
 an let her play trivia crack on U
 Those r two sacred acts
 LOL
 no she doesn't
 it's clearly Ireland
 lol
 did I do that
 and didn‚Äôt rape her
 ‚Äúwhat country is also a continent?‚Äù
 she picks africa
 ‚Äúhahaha I even took geography last semesterrrrrrrr‚Äù
 that's why they're all midgets who wear green
 they've been so land isolated that they developed their own midget culture
 and haven't yet assimilated w the rest of the civilized world
 is this ur pillowtalk or some shit
 nah just got home
 so now I'm bored and thinking ab hilarious dumb girls are
 how hilarious*
 awkward
 I‚Äôve been holding interviews for people to join my dev team
 as a part of the ‚Äúproduct development‚Äù side of the newspaper
 I've decided a BS in CS will mean nothing in 3 years
 considering how retarded half the kids in the program are
 one kid comes in
 ‚Äúso in what language are you most proficient‚Äù
 ‚Äújava‚Äù
 ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your favorite website/online service‚Äù
 ‚Äúprobably google bc no matter what you search there are always a couple of porn links hidden in the back‚Äù
 did he actually say that
 He started off talking about ‚Äúsearch trends‚Äù
 and then swerved into that telephone pole of a topic
 u can get ur interviews down to one question
 just ask them to solve a problem
 ‚Äúcan you buzz as much as you fizz?‚Äù
 lmao no but seriously
 they'll go for their most comfortable language
 instead of just telling u what u want to hear
 plus half of people who know how to program
 don't know how to program
 I really don‚Äôt get how that happens
 do they just copy their assignments or turn in shit that doesn‚Äôt compile
 idk I have 0 faith in students
 all the interns we've had
 idk bc all the Cs classes I took
 at umass
 were so easy to BS thru bc there were sm kids
 your programs just had to pass the unit tester
 and were checked for plagiarism
 how do u make it harder
 at a school that big
 in like the 2nd biggest major
 why did that make it easy
 how do you BS code
 their were 175 kids in my sophomore Cs class
 85 probably did the assignment and the rest
 Jumbled around what the others wrote
 to pass a super basic plagiarism test
 can u do me a favor
 text (516) 864-4091 test
 oh yeah classic
 using the refactoring tool on eclipse to rename your variables
 okay I see
 woah!
 now try 911
 text it 911
 don't text 911 test
 thx for the clarification
 ok thanks
 Trynna come up w a covert way to stop date rape for my boss

 Must be the new advanced scan
 That checks more on the barcode
 It can also hook up to intellius
 Which is just a database of people

 I got $50
 good
 it was fun that's why I played tho
 I just played 5$ at a time
 Go for that long game
 wowow!
 I wanted to play video poker but there was a long line of elderly mestizos
 video poker is bs
 I don't like games where whether I win is predetermined
 the world is predetermined
 on a macro scale
 Yo
 Sup

 Train

 I have a pill cutter they're kind of a bitch to break
 Yes please
 everyone who finds out I have a scrip laughs and then
 asks for some lmao
 Did I laugh??
 idk
 Just funny how socially acceptable it is
 To take Viagra
 It's like more ok for young people to take it
 I haven't looked at any porn for like 3 weeks to prepare
 lmao
 have you had performance issues?
 it's usually just being nervous n not anything else
 Yeah
 Esp if I've been talking to the girl for a while
 Viagra turns ur dick into a samurai sword but it's the confidence that ur taking Viagra that does anything
 Right
 So speaking of
 How're u and the missus
 good
 Taking her to Florida in two weeks
 For her bday
 Ah yes
Nice!
 which was in January

 u were with me when I didn't have this job

 so I don't feel bad paying for a trip
 at this point it‚Äôs just an early present for next year
 good but got way too much sun
 70spf w zinc couldn't save my white ass
 ride or die
 won a ton of money in the casino
 Then lost it
 how was PR
 Then won some back
 is it?
 i don‚Äôt get how blackjack is 49% in your favor
 black jack is like
 but it must be
 win big and then leave
 time is against you
 I was saying it's less than 49%
 I would say it's like 35% in your favor
 how could a casino play a game where the long odds aren‚Äôt in its favor
 With the use of the right blackjack basic strategy, you will have the opportunity to turn the casino edge in blackjack from 7-8 percent down to just 0. 5 percent.
 I didn't count cards but I definitely kept track of how heavy the deck was
 4 or 6
 can't remember
 how many decks did they use
 it was really low security
 hmm
 tricky
 I wish I had known in advance
 I would've made something to help me win
 where I went, my friend started taking pictures of the slot machine
 when he got a bonus round
 and a guy came over and made him delete the pics
 buttons on my toes to keep track of cards
 And phone vibrate to give feedback
 It was like the most ghetto casino ever
 The dealers couldn't count
 so they'd think I won and give me money
 And think I lost and I'd have to be like no
 Which worked in my favor
 once they give you the money they don't take it back
 but if ur like BS I won
 They'll give u ur money
 hahahaha
 it was all a ruse to try and get you to play big
 the best part was if u sit at a machine
 I won a ton of money from the video poker machines
 and you put in like a penny so that it‚Äôs being ‚Äúplayed‚Äù
 Weirdest luck ever I had no idea what I was doing
 they‚Äôll come over and give u free drinks and sandwiches
 I spent like 3$ won like 100$
 Are they still working you like a dog
 Ya lol
 Got a good side gig going tho
 When you have time you have no money and when you have money you have no time
 At least in the beginning
 Is the side gig Ian's fridge
 Or fleekseat
 Different

 Without a green screen?

 What if I need you for 40 some weeks and 30 others
 I think I can a manage
 And then if you want to slap a 50 in there somewhere once
 I'll visit Emma and we'll be fine
 I think someone snuck in and stole my wallet while I was on klonopin
 Nvm
 I do feel very relaxed tho
 Lmao
 You're funny
 I was cool with it being gone
 No worries whatsoever
 That's how it works
 It's pretty fantastic
 Ôøº
 Ôøº
 is there an easter egg i‚Äôm missing
 are you taking that mutilated mac in
 When do you think you can get things set up with overture?
 Working on getting a budget
 Where did you pull this "x100,000" out of
 Upper ceiling of where I see it ending
 I see companies out sourcing to this frequently
 Finding engineers and paying them is a lot do work
 Do freelancers interview
 A key part of this is vetting, right
 We vet all engineers
 Making sure that people are as capable as they claim
 In the beginning at least
 On reliability, ability, and speed
 After that it is self curating
 Ok
 Think mechanical Turk
 For real work
 Not impressed
 I saw them earlier
 https://pickcrew.com/
 Have you gone through a quote yet
 Yes
 This is very expensive
 how is this any different
 I am targeting a different market
 what makes you stand out?
 I want to use talented college students to do work in their free time for less than a seasoned developer
 have I signed up and gotten a quote for a potential job?
 I want to curate them
 I want to get them a great rate
 And I want them to get work experience
 There will be 3 tiers of service
 what market
 And it will be instant
 It won't be
 Get a quote
 It will be
 Boom
 You are talking to someone
 It's premium concierge development
 I‚Äôm googling
 No
 That's one service
 Imagine omegle
 You click a button
 And you're talking to someone
 Except this someone is seasoned in his field
 And can create your software
 Students will handle
 so less experienced developers
 Small projects for companies
 for very cheap
 Not complete products
 Students lack product dev skills
 There is also an entire other component
 Don't send me a site
 That looks like that
 Ever again
 There's no reviewing
 We vet
 http://www.codingcupboard.com/
 This looks so convoluted
 Yes we do
 All uber drivers are vetted
 that does what you‚Äôre describing
 We can reach critical mass on one end but not the other
 We don't need a million developers
 not after critical mass we don‚Äôt
 You'll see once I make it
 unless you want to expand accordingly
 Make a proper site
 I'm used to competing
 That's where the fun is
 No idea has no similar but failed competitors
 I'm going to bed we'll talk in the am
 make a proper proposal?
 I'm glad ur here tho
 You're how I normally am
 V skeptical
 Appreciate the thought you're putting into it
 Keep it up
 ok
 What are you dropping
 Nah keep em
 Well keep room for you on the side
 How many hours is each
 Assuming you get bitly
 hahah well you‚Äôre asking me to drop anything and follow you into the sunset
 everything
 Send them w message
 I just want to know exactly what I‚Äôm getting into
 possible bit.ly
 definite Columbia IT
 Tell them you've received numerous other offers but you're the biggest bitly fan and it's where you've wanted to work since before college
 ok
 bit.ly has been silent
 I've used it since
 8th grade
 So I think so
 hahah have they even been around since then
 ah yes 2008
 ah well
 if you don‚Äôt want full time then that‚Äôs a lot more doable
 but I‚Äôll continue to give it thought
 Wanna unblock me
 In the interim
 On fb?
 Yea
 I'm deactivated
 As of when?
 Well I started in October
 Came back on April 1st
 I have messages from Facebook user
 On Tuesday
 Then I turned it back on a couple days ago to download all the pics I was tagged in
 Bc the "download an archive of your data" feature doesn't do that
 Was the stuff about the FBI hiring you
 Yes
 why do you keep it deactivated
 I'm trying to limit the distractions in my life
 Overture
 which of your endeavors are you recruiting for on twitter
 Since when is there a Port filter
 like today
 It's lame
 Yes
 Ôøºu on weekends
 lol
 So
 ?
 I shouldn't apply for either visible world or overture
 Right
 you got bitly?
 No
 I don't know yet
 It's so late
 When do thy lyk
 Unclear
 I'm also interviewing with a ML map startup downtown this week
 how goes the intern search
 did people reach out to you through twitter
 I have like 400 emails
 Don't even have time to read them
 Have some Asian girl handling it
 Hah wow
 so exhausted
 how goes summer
 Just started
 Last final was at 4 to
 jealous
 Td
 is Tom in Macedonia yet
 I think you mean Lebanon
 I was saying a random location
 Yeah I think so
 is Lebanon even a super safe place to be
 Sounds like quite an awful place to be currently
 Does he know kurds aren't a type of cheese
 I would‚Äôve thought he‚Äôd have sent a snapchat with a BOSNIA LIFE geotag by now
 maybe they don‚Äôt have the necessary infrastructure
 I've never been more confused
 Me too
 wtf was that
 where r u
 Some dorm I think
 I just remember carrying it around in a cardboard crate
 And then looking for salt frantically
 do you still have it.....
 I don't know where that bathtub is lol
 RIP rob the lob
 bitly went well
 they asked me to design their core functionality from the beginning
 like in an interview?
 n how‚Äôd u say u were to do it
 yeah
 how would I make a link shortening service
 i assume i have a base url with two endpoints
 just example.com/ allows you to post a string, which is a link
 that gets hashed
 the key of the hash starts at, lets say ‚Äòa‚Äô and then increments to whatever, ‚ÄòZ‚Äô, and then you add a new character when you run out
 the value is the url ofc
 that gets put into the db
 well, first it gets put into a cache
 of most recently added/accessed links
 and I went into how you can have one database with multiple instances of the app running at once
 and how to avoid collisions
 then the other endpoint is example.com/<hash>
 which just takes it, gets the argument, checks the cache, then the db, then does a redirect
 if you have multiple instances of the app running
 then the way that you‚Äôd hash it is, let‚Äôs say you have a list of every possible key
 a through ZZZZZZ or whatever
 you take the number of servers running
 lets say 5
 and then each server starts at a different index, 0 thru 4, of the list of keys
 and every time it uses one, it increments by the number of servers
 so you go a ‚Äî > f, b ‚Äî > g, and so on
 and then they said, let‚Äôs say every 1000 links, each server keeps track of how many times its incremented through the index list
 and one of them goes down
 where would you reposition it?
 so I said that I‚Äôd just take the last endpoint and then go to the index at position (1000 * number_of_servers)
 ahead of the last *checkpoint
 nice
 did they give any feedback
 lol
 do u have any feedback
 yes
 that i thank god i‚Äôm not a backend dev
 oooook
 they said they liked what they saw
 hahahah
 they‚Äôre going to tell the lead that they have a good feeling about me
 and then he‚Äôll call next week and make sure I‚Äôm legit and then I‚Äôm in
 I feel the same way about frontend dw
 noice
 how many interns do they take
 they have a few teams
 they probably take a couple on each
 they don‚Äôt have that many employees
 they have an application team and a data science team
 so I think each one has one or two
 probably one
 the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians?
 oh
 are you in port?
 I just remembered LTBB lets you order through text
 then why are you ordering
 Let There Be Bagels you philistine
 no

 7ish blocks
 We can def get lunch
 Trying that new program
 Which one
 Harvard Business School HBX
 First class
 Is it like Netflix
 With everything available at once
 it's by hbs
 it's the case study method
 sort of
 it's like 1 season is released at a time
 Yeah that's what the promo vid said
 "I loved the real life cases!"
 And you have to finish before the next season is released
 It's more for fun
 Doesn't really hold any
 Weight
 I'd imagine
 They do reject people, just no idea how many
 I'm also moving in a week
 My own flat until August
 Oh well that's early!
 Did someone respond on Twitter
 then moving w Ian in August
 nah found it online
 Woman's going out of town to do a residency for 8 weeks
 Nice
 Where is it
 basically my life's a mess
 williamsburg/bushbuck
 Stfu
 it's so much to handle
 Struggling to keep it together
 Apartment will help
 In two weeks we pitch the app to a branding company
 Then shit gets even more insane
 I don't even know how people afford to live
 When does bitly start
 Next Monday
 What shit
 The World Trade Center thing
 yeah
 haha I told her to apply to that
 nice
 how the hell is Ali getting into al this shit
 the program is for underrepresented minorities in tech
 aka women and Spanish people
 idgi u have bitly
 jealousy never helps nobody
 is that where Kensho is?
 that and now she‚Äôs doing this exclusive Google program
 no company wants to hire a female engineer
 where they teach her how to build an android app and they coach her on technical interviews
 The cultures not there
 wtf phil
 Everyone wants female interns tho
 why is she your favorite????
 ugh
 WOMEN
 Is the wtc thing not nepitism?
 phil should I go trans
 to get into google
 I assumed she knew someone
 She's also not
 Programming
 yeah yeah yeah
 At kensho
 Which is kinda a big drawback
 Resume wise
 I see
 because I was talking to her and she didn‚Äôt seem THAT far ahead
 "Thank you!! At a startup called Kensho. Doing data science (not software) but still excited for experience"
 god
 I don't know what that means
 if only i was a black woman
 If she just said data science I'd assume programming models
 yeah what does her dad do
 But she said NOT software
 If you're programming its software
 yeah I bet she's a product manager
 so what does ‚Äúdata science‚Äù mean
 good call
 y does other people's shit worry u
 u couldn't be in a better place
 if u tried
 lol
 u seem a little miffed
 maybe it‚Äôs like, high-level product manager shit
 being charismatic helps a lot
 compensates for a lot of lack in skill
 I‚Äôm not
 I know kids who are doing real google
 and mastercard
 I just woke up
 and I was a little baffled how she was doing so well
 Malik
 lol*** jeez
 Fizzbuzz is like
 Have you taken comp sci 101
 Do u have basic problem solving ability
 you can‚Äôt smoothtalk your way through fizzbuzz
 if you can't check remainders in a loop u prolly should go back to school
 yea bc every programmer ever has imposter syndrome
 It takes a while to get comfortable
 yeah her dad is the editor on ‚ÄúInstitutional Investor‚Äù
 people get frustrated because they think there‚Äôs a more elegant solution
 than three conditional mods
 yea it has many perks
 side note
 I gotta say
 hotel tonight makes it real cheap too
 having a hotel room with a gf
 strong move
 I can see why you like doing it
 obvs
 I wish they'd skip the bullshit
 We get it Mexicans exist
 are you watching google i/o
 lmao
 ugh
 product people
 I'm pumped for this hbx thing
 Everyone who graduated said it was great but I'm skeptical
 I'm in June
 There's been a few classes before me
 What is first class
 What does that mean
 I'm in core
 It's 3 programs
 Analytics, accounting, and economics
 Or something like that
 you did the first class?
 It's not prestigious I don't think it's just a really good way to learn
 like the first lesson
 Harvard Business School looks good on my linkedin too lmao

 Yes
 And I'm on a plane
 it's an online favor
 Can I do it on my phone
 Yah
 I want to artificially increase the bid on my eBay listing
 Lol
 You already have a ton of bids
 Ik but the current bidder has a max set
 Of what seems like 500
 So I want to judge it
 There's not really a risk to you I can always cancel your bid
 Okay so you want me to bid
 Yeah bid 475
 Done
 R u highest
 Yes
 Damn
 Someone bid 460 as I placed it
 If I'm the highest bidder in three hours u can definitely give it to the next highest instead
 Is my bid showing up? I'm not really an active ebayer
 Ur top bidder
 Asshole
 Hope u like ur new apple watch
 Nooooiooooooo
 I'm kidding it'll go up
 It better
 ?
 You get the option
 To give to the next bidder
 O
 I thought I "entered a binding contract"
 W/e
 Gotta fly
